# night
- did not perform the morning routine properly. skipped the gratitude journaling part. this did seems to have affected me in a negative way
- got a lot of work done today, but still felt like I did not do a lot.
- pushed myself to stay back for beer friday. did not enjoy it. just added to the mental worry when I was going home that I was late. staying far away kinda sucks
- not a lot of things went according to plan today. did kinda make me a little cranky by the end of the day
