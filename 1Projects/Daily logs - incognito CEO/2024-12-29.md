# night
- really good day. was able to finish most of what I planned
- updated my resume with the new values
- finished sync service code
- created a monthly spreadsheet that I can use to track my expenditure
- found out my current investments
- got a new watch that looks really good, and very functional
- still need to do some more trivial tasks here and there
