# Night
- was not happy with how things turned out today.
- spent a lot of time in traffic jams than anything else
- had a singular focus today while working, but was still very slow in working
- did not require a lot of planning today. did not do a lot of things
- stayed a lot of time in office today. came back to more work
- only positive thing today is me getting information about the weekly reviews. Natraj has some information about some coaching that employees take (only seniors)
