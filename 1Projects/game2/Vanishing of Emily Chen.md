# Stage 1: The Initial Investigation

## Scenario

Emily Chen was reported missing by her roommate, Jasmine Taylor, after not returning home for 48 hours. Emily was last seen leaving her workplace, TechFusion Inc., on Wednesday evening. Your first task is to gather preliminary information and establish a timeline.

## Clues

1. **Emily's Work Desk**: A neat workspace with a calendar showing a circled date (Friday) with "MT - 8PM" written on it.
2. **Security Footage**: Shows Emily leaving the office at 7:15 PM on Wednesday, looking at her phone while walking.
3. **Emily's Phone Records**: Last call was to a contact saved as "Alex" at 7:20 PM on Wednesday, lasting 3 minutes.
4. **Email from Boss**: Subject line "Re: Project Deadline Extension" sent Wednesday at 5:30 PM.
5. **Recent Credit Card Activity**: $67.50 charge at "Riverside Café" on Wednesday at 7:45 PM.

## Suspects & Statements

### Jasmine Taylor (Roommate)

"Emily and I have been roommates for two years. She's super reliable, always lets me know if she'll be out late. Wednesday morning she seemed excited about something, but wouldn't tell me what. She mentioned meeting someone for dinner that night. I tried calling her multiple times Thursday when she didn't come home, but it went straight to voicemail."

### Marcus Reid (Boss at TechFusion)

"Emily is one of our most dedicated employees. She was working on a major project due next week. She requested a deadline extension on Wednesday, which I approved. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, though she did leave earlier than usual for her. She normally stays until at least 8:00 PM."

### Alex Patel (Colleague)

"Emily called me after work on Wednesday to ask about the Richardson client files. Nothing unusual about the conversation. She mentioned she was heading to meet someone for dinner but didn't say who. We're friends, but she keeps her personal life pretty private."

### Server at Riverside Café

"I remember that woman. She was here Wednesday evening, sitting at a corner table. She seemed to be waiting for someone, checking her phone a lot. After about 30 minutes, she looked upset, paid for her drink, and left. She was alone the whole time."

# Stage 2: Following the Digital Trail

## Scenario

After establishing Emily's last known whereabouts at Riverside Café, you've obtained a warrant to access her email and social media accounts. The digital forensics team has also recovered data from her laptop found at her apartment. You need to piece together what Emily was involved in before her disappearance.

## Clues

1. **Email Thread**: Several emails exchanged between Emily and "mthomas@innovatech.com" over the past month, discussing a "potential opportunity."
2. **Browser History**: Multiple visits to InnovaTech's website and LinkedIn searches for "Michael Thomas, InnovaTech."
3. **Private Document**: A non-disclosure agreement from InnovaTech, partially filled out but not signed.
4. **Text Messages**: A message sent to contact "Mika" at 8:20 PM on Wednesday: "Where are you? I've been waiting for 20 minutes."
5. **Bank Statement**: Recent $5,000 deposit into Emily's account on Monday from "MT Consulting, LLC."
6. **Deleted Email**: Recovered email with subject "RE: Our Arrangement" from Michael Thomas sent Tuesday: "Remember, complete discretion is essential. Looking forward to our meeting tomorrow. Will bring the rest then."

## Suspects & Statements

### Michael Thomas (Executive at InnovaTech)

"Yes, I was supposed to meet Emily on Wednesday, but I had to cancel last minute due to a family emergency. I texted her to reschedule but never heard back. We were discussing a potential job opportunity for her at InnovaTech. I sent her a consulting fee advance because she'd already done some preliminary work for us, analyzing some of our systems. There's nothing suspicious about it."

### Ryan Zhang (Emily's Ex-Boyfriend)

"We broke up two months ago, but it was amicable. I knew she was unhappy at TechFusion and looking for other opportunities. Emily mentioned something about a big career move recently, but she wouldn't give me details. Said it was 'confidential.' I was worried she was getting involved in something sketchy."

### Mika Davis (Emily's Friend)

"Emily told me she was meeting with someone who could 'change her life' on Wednesday night. She was being really secretive about it, which isn't like her. She did mention that TechFusion and InnovaTech are major competitors, and that's why she had to be careful. I texted her Thursday morning to see how it went, but she never responded."

### Carl Winters (TechFusion Security Officer)

"I've reviewed the badge access logs. Emily had been accessing the server room after hours multiple times in the past two weeks. That's unusual for someone in her position. When I mentioned it to her last Monday, she seemed nervous and said it was authorized work for Marcus."

## Your Investigation Tasks

1. Determine the nature of Emily's relationship with Michael Thomas
2. Investigate the reason for the $5,000 payment
3. Establish whether Emily was engaged in corporate espionage
4. Assess whether her disappearance is connected to her work

## Hints

<details> <summary>Hint 1</summary> The deleted email suggests a more secretive arrangement than a simple job offer. </details> <details> <summary>Hint 2</summary> Consider the timing - why would a consulting fee be paid before any official paperwork was signed? </details> <details> <summary>Hint 3</summary> Emily's unusual access to the server room at TechFusion combined with her communications with a rival company executive raises significant concerns. </details>

## Solution

<details> <summary>Stage 2 Solution</summary>

**Key Findings:**

- Emily was in negotiations with Michael Thomas from InnovaTech, a direct competitor to her employer
- She received $5,000 from Michael's company before any official hiring paperwork was completed
- Emily had been accessing the TechFusion server room after hours without clear authorization
- The language in the deleted email ("our arrangement" and "complete discretion") suggests something beyond a normal job change
- Michael claims to have texted Emily to cancel, but there's no evidence of this in her messages

**Deductions:**

- Emily was likely being paid to obtain confidential information from TechFusion
- Michael Thomas may have been recruiting Emily for corporate espionage
- The meeting at Riverside Café may have been to exchange information
- Either Michael is lying about texting to cancel, or someone deleted the message from Emily's phone
- Emily's disappearance may be connected to this apparent corporate espionage situation

**Next Steps:**

- Investigate Michael Thomas more thoroughly
- Determine what information Emily may have accessed in the server room
- Locate Emily's whereabouts after leaving the café

# Stage 3: The Unexpected Connection

## Scenario

Your investigation has revealed Emily's involvement with InnovaTech and possible corporate espionage. While searching Emily's apartment more thoroughly, you discover a hidden USB drive and a notebook with encoded entries. Meanwhile, a witness has come forward claiming to have seen Emily after she left the café.

## Clues

1. **Hidden USB Drive**: Contains encrypted files labeled "TF-Project-Nexus" and "IT-Proposal."
2. **Notebook**: Contains what appears to be a coded journal with dates and times, including a final entry for Wednesday: "R.S. - 9:30 - Overlook."
3. **Witness Statement**: A rideshare driver reports picking up a woman matching Emily's description from near Riverside Café around 8:30 PM Wednesday and dropping her at Overlook Park.
4. **Phone Location Data**: Emily's phone last pinged near Overlook Park at 9:45 PM Wednesday before going offline.
5. **Security Camera**: Footage from a gas station near Overlook Park shows Emily meeting with someone in a parked car at 9:35 PM. The car's license plate is partially visible: "LS-8--"
6. **Anonymous Tip**: A call received claiming that Emily was "in way over her head with the Thomas situation."

## Suspects & Statements

### Rachel Santos (TechFusion Project Manager)

"I've known Emily for three years. We were working together on Project Nexus, which is a major new security platform. I had no idea she was talking to InnovaTech. But yes, I did meet her Wednesday night at Overlook Park. She texted me after her dinner fell through, sounding upset. She wanted to tell me something important, said she'd made a mistake. When we met, she gave me a USB drive and told me to keep it safe, said she needed to 'fix things' before it was too late. That was the last time I saw her."

### Lucas Stevens (InnovaTech Security Director)

"I've never met Emily Chen personally. Michael Thomas never informed me about recruiting her or any consulting arrangement. That's unusual since I oversee all security clearances for new hires. I did speak with Michael several times about Project Nexus - we've been trying to develop something similar. As for Wednesday night, I was at home with my wife. My car is a black sedan with plate LST-835."

### Marcus Reid (Revisited)

"Project Nexus is our most confidential initiative. If Emily was stealing information about it, that's a serious security breach. But I find it hard to believe. She's always been loyal to the company. Though now that I think about it, she did ask some unusual questions about our security protocols recently, claiming it was for 'optimization purposes.'"

### Jasmine Taylor (Roommate, Revisited)

"After you asked about Emily's relationships, I remembered something. She mentioned a 'Rachel' from work a few times recently, said they were getting close. But last week I overheard them arguing on the phone. Emily said something like 'That wasn't our agreement' and 'It's not worth the risk.' I assumed it was work-related and didn't think much of it until now."

## Your Investigation Tasks

1. Determine the significance of the meeting at Overlook Park
2. Identify the owner of the car in the security footage
3. Understand the relationship between Emily and Rachel
4. Assess whether Emily was having second thoughts about her actions

## Hints

<details> <summary>Hint 1</summary> The coded notebook entry "R.S. - 9:30 - Overlook" likely refers to Rachel Santos and their meeting time and location. </details> <details> <summary>Hint 2</summary> Consider why Emily would trust Rachel with the USB drive after apparently stealing company information. </details> <details> <summary>Hint 3</summary> Lucas Stevens' license plate (LST-835) partially matches the one visible in the security footage (LS-8--). </details>

## Solution

<details> <summary>Stage 3 Solution</summary>

**Key Findings:**

- Emily met with Rachel Santos at Overlook Park at approximately 9:30 PM
- She gave Rachel a USB drive, saying she had "made a mistake" and needed to "fix things"
- Emily's phone went offline at 9:45 PM near Overlook Park
- A car with a license plate beginning with "LS-8" was at the park meeting spot
- Lucas Stevens' car has plate "LST-835" which matches the partial plate
- Emily and Rachel had a recent argument about "risk" and "agreement"
- The anonymous tip suggested Emily was in trouble regarding "the Thomas situation"

**Deductions:**

- Emily may have been a double agent - appearing to help InnovaTech while actually gathering evidence of their attempts at corporate espionage
- Rachel Santos appears to have been Emily's confidante at TechFusion
- Lucas Stevens may have been at Overlook Park despite his denial
- Emily seems to have had second thoughts about her involvement
- Emily's disappearance likely occurred shortly after her meeting with Rachel
- The USB drive Emily gave to Rachel may contain crucial evidence

**Next Steps:**

- Interview Rachel more extensively about the contents of the USB drive
- Investigate Lucas Stevens' movements on Wednesday night
- Determine whether Emily was working with corporate security at TechFusion

</details>

# Stage 4: The Betrayal

## Scenario

The case has taken a dramatic turn. The contents of the USB drive have been analyzed, revealing a complex web of corporate espionage. Additionally, search teams have found Emily's jacket discarded near a hiking trail adjacent to Overlook Park. Your focus now shifts to the final moments before Emily's disappearance.

## Clues

1. **USB Contents**: Documents showing Michael Thomas had been attempting to recruit several TechFusion employees, plus audio recordings of conversations between Emily and Michael where she appears to be gathering evidence.
2. **Emily's Jacket**: Found with a tear on the sleeve and soil stains. A small piece of paper in the pocket has "L.S. - Blackmail" written on it.
3. **Surveillance Images**: Traffic cameras show Lucas Stevens' car entering Overlook Park at 9:25 PM and leaving at 9:55 PM on Wednesday.
4. **Rachel's Bank Records**: Show a $10,000 deposit from an offshore account on Thursday morning.
5. **Recovered Text Message**: Deleted message from Lucas Stevens to Emily at 9:15 PM Wednesday: "Change of plans. Meet at the hiking trail entrance instead. Come alone."
6. **Witness Report**: Park ranger noted a "heated argument between a man and two women" near the trail entrance around 9:40 PM but didn't intervene.

## Suspects & Statements

### Rachel Santos (Reinterviewed)

"Fine, I'll tell you everything. Emily approached me a month ago saying she'd been contacted by InnovaTech. She was worried they were trying to steal Project Nexus details. We decided she would play along but document everything for corporate security. But then... Lucas Stevens contacted me separately. He offered money to keep quiet about their operation and to help him retrieve whatever evidence Emily had collected. I agreed to meet her at the park, but I swear I thought Lucas just wanted the USB drive. I didn't know he would... I never saw her after she walked toward the trail to meet him. I should have done something."

### Lucas Stevens (Reinterviewed)

"This is absurd. I never sent any text to Emily Chen. I've never even had her number. Yes, I was at Overlook Park Wednesday night, but for a completely different reason. I was meeting an anonymous informant about potential security leaks at InnovaTech. No one showed up. As for this supposed payment to Rachel Santos, I know nothing about it. Someone is clearly trying to frame me."

### Carl Winters (TechFusion Security)

"I've been working with corporate security on this for weeks. Emily came to me after Michael Thomas' initial approach. We set up a counter-intelligence operation, with Emily gathering evidence of InnovaTech's attempted espionage. Only three people knew: me, Emily, and our CEO. We deliberately kept Marcus out of the loop in case there was an internal leak. Rachel Santos was never part of the operation. Emily was supposed to turn over all evidence on Thursday morning."

### Park Ranger Denise Morris

"I was doing my final patrol when I heard raised voices near the east trail entrance. It was dark, but I could make out silhouettes of what looked like one man and two women. The man seemed to be confronting the women, and one woman was standing back. I called out, and they all quickly separated. The man went toward the parking lot, one woman hurried down the trail, and the other woman followed the man. I regret not investigating further, but we've had issues with teenagers arguing in the park before, so I didn't think it was serious."

## Your Investigation Tasks

1. Determine who sent the text to Emily from Lucas' number
2. Identify the third person at the park confrontation
3. Establish Rachel's true role in the events
4. Determine what happened to Emily after the trail encounter

## Hints

<details> <summary>Hint 1</summary> Consider why Rachel admitted to meeting Emily but omitted the three-person confrontation observed by the park ranger. </details> <details> <summary>Hint 2</summary> The note "L.S. - Blackmail" in Emily's pocket suggests she may have been threatening to expose Lucas Stevens. </details> <details> <summary>Hint 3</summary> Think about who would benefit from Emily's disappearance and who had knowledge of all the players involved. </details>

## Solution

<details> <summary>Stage 4 Solution</summary>

**Key Findings:**

- Emily was working with TechFusion security to gather evidence against InnovaTech
- Rachel was not part of the official counter-intelligence operation
- Rachel received a large payment after Emily's disappearance
- Lucas Stevens was at Overlook Park despite initial denials
- A confrontation between three people (one man, two women) occurred at the trail
- The text from "Lucas" to Emily may have been sent to lure her to a secluded location

**Deductions:**

- Rachel appears to have been a double agent, working with Lucas Stevens
- Lucas likely came to retrieve Emily's evidence and silence her
- Rachel probably arranged the meeting and betrayed Emily
- The third person at the confrontation was likely Rachel, despite her claim of not seeing what happened
- Emily may have been planning to blackmail Lucas Stevens with the evidence she gathered
- After the confrontation, Emily fled down the trail while Rachel followed Lucas to the parking lot

**Next Steps:**

- Search the hiking trail more thoroughly
- Investigate the source of Rachel's payment
- Determine if Michael Thomas was aware of Lucas Stevens' actions

</details>

# Stage 5: The Final Revelation

## Scenario

It's been a week since Emily Chen disappeared. Based on your investigation, search teams have focused on an abandoned ranger cabin 3 miles along the hiking trail from Overlook Park. Meanwhile, technical analysts have traced the offshore payment to Rachel and recovered deleted communications between the suspects. You must now solve the case and determine Emily's fate.

## Clues

1. **Ranger Cabin Search**: Signs of recent occupation including food wrappers, a burner phone, and hiking boots matching Emily's size.
2. **Final Text**: Message from the burner phone to an unknown number on Friday: "Deal complete. Heading to rendezvous point. ETA 3 hours."
3. **Surveillance Photo**: Security camera from a bus station 20 miles from the park showing a woman resembling Emily, wearing a hoodie and sunglasses, boarding a bus to Montreal on Friday afternoon.
4. **Email Chain**: Recovered emails between Lucas Stevens and Michael Thomas discussing a "containment protocol" for "situations where assets become liabilities."
5. **Recorded Conversation**: Audio file from Emily's cloud backup of a conversation between her and Rachel: "I know they're planning something bigger than just stealing Project Nexus. This goes all the way to the top."
6. **Bank Alert**: A new account opened in Quebec on Saturday under the name "Emma Chang" with an initial deposit of $50,000 transferred from a Cayman Islands account linked to Lucas Stevens.

## Suspects & Statements

### Michael Thomas (Under Formal Questioning)

"Look, I wanted TechFusion's technology, yes. I authorized Lucas to recruit their employees, including Emily. But I never signed off on anything illegal beyond standard corporate espionage. When Lucas told me Emily was gathering evidence against us, I told him to just back off the operation. He said he would 'handle it.' I didn't ask questions. That's how our industry works. If Emily disappeared or... worse... that's on Lucas, not me."

### Rachel Santos (In Custody)

"It wasn't supposed to happen like this. Lucas convinced me Emily was actually a corporate spy for another company, not just gathering evidence against InnovaTech. He said we needed to scare her into giving up all her information. When we confronted her at the trail, she panicked and ran. Lucas went after her. He came back alone and said she'd agreed to a deal - money for her silence and all copies of the evidence. I swear I thought she was okay. The money I received was my payment for helping arrange the meeting, nothing more sinister."

### Lucas Stevens (In Custody)

"Fine. Project Nexus wasn't the real target. TechFusion has been developing classified cybersecurity protocols for government applications. That's what we wanted. Emily figured it out and threatened to expose everything. She demanded money to keep quiet. I met her at the cabin two days after the park incident. We negotiated a deal - $50,000 and a new identity in exchange for her silence and all evidence. I arranged her transportation to Canada. She's alive and well, just living under a new name. This was a mutual agreement, not a kidnapping."

### Bus Driver Statement

"Yeah, I remember that woman. She was nervous, kept looking around. Paid in cash for a ticket to Montreal. She was carrying just one small backpack. Didn't talk to anyone during boarding. I noticed because she kept her sunglasses on even though it was evening."

## Your Investigation Tasks

1. Determine if Emily Chen is alive or dead
2. Establish who is telling the truth about the events after the park confrontation
3. Identify all parties involved in the conspiracy
4. Determine whether Emily was a victim or willing participant in her disappearance

## Hints

<details> <summary>Hint 1</summary> Compare the timeline of the text from the ranger cabin, the bus station sighting, and the new bank account in Quebec. </details> <details> <summary>Hint 2</summary> Consider Emily's character throughout the investigation. Would she willingly participate in extortion? </details> <details> <summary>Hint 3</summary> Review the escalating nature of Emily's discoveries - from corporate espionage to potential government security breaches. </details>

## Solution

<details> <summary>Stage 5 Solution</summary>

**The Truth Revealed:**

Emily Chen is alive in Canada under the assumed identity of Emma Chang. The full sequence of events was:

1. Emily was originally approached by InnovaTech to steal information about Project Nexus
2. She reported this to TechFusion security and began gathering evidence of corporate espionage
3. During her investigation, Emily discovered Project Nexus had government cybersecurity applications
4. Rachel Santos was secretly working with Lucas Stevens as an informant within TechFusion
5. When Emily confronted Rachel about her suspicions, Rachel alerted Lucas
6. The meeting at Overlook Park was a confrontation where Emily realized both Rachel and Lucas were involved
7. Emily fled down the trail to the ranger cabin, where she hid for two days
8. Lucas tracked her down and they negotiated a deal - her silence and evidence in exchange for money and a new identity
9. Emily agreed, seeing it as her only safe option after discovering the extent of the conspiracy
10. She took a bus to Montreal and established a new identity using the money from Lucas

**Final Assessment:**

- Emily began as a whistleblower but eventually chose self-preservation when she realized how dangerous the situation had become
- Michael Thomas authorized corporate espionage but likely did not approve the more extreme measures
- Lucas Stevens orchestrated the cover-up and payment to Emily
- Rachel Santos betrayed Emily for financial gain
- The real victim is national security, as classified cybersecurity protocols were compromised
- Emily's disappearance was initially not voluntary, but her flight to Canada was ultimately her choice

**Case Resolution:**

- Lucas Stevens and Rachel Santos are charged with conspiracy and corporate espionage
- Michael Thomas is charged with attempted theft of trade secrets
- International authorities are working to locate Emily Chen/Emma Chang as a material witness
- TechFusion is cooperating with federal authorities regarding the compromised security protocols
- The case remains partially open pending Emily's testimony
