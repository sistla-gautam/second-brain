I aspire to get a consulting role in a esteemed organization where I can drive impactful solutions and contribute to organizational success. To achieve this, I aim to enhance my management expertise, gain practical experience in business operations, and strengthen my team management capabilities. IIM Kozhikode aligns perfectly with my career aspirations, offering a platform to develop advanced business acumen, collaborate with a diverse peer group, and leverage opportunities that support my professional growth and long-term objectives.

**Describe your strengths and weakness as identified by you.**

One of my key strengths is my ability to work effectively in team settings, fostering collaboration and ensuring that all perspectives are valued. I also possess strong communication skills, enabling me to articulate ideas clearly and build meaningful professional relationships. Additionally, I excel under pressure, maintaining focus and delivering high-quality results even in demanding situations.

A key area for improvement is time management. I sometimes find it challenging to prioritize effectively, especially when managing multiple responsibilities. To address this, I have adopted tools such as planners and digital calendars to organize my tasks better. By consistently applying these methods, I am steadily improving my ability to manage time more efficiently and balance competing priorities effectively.

**What is your most significant accomplishment so far ?**

During my pre final year of college, I discovered an opportunity to work as a social media manager for a fashion event. Despite my initial hesitation and fear of reaching out to unfamiliar people, I decided to step out of my comfort zone, made the call, and successfully secured the role. This experience was pivotal in building my confidence and strengthening my professional communication skills.

**What are your present hobbies ?**

My current hobbies include listening to audiobooks, particularly in the sci-fi and fantasy genres. I find these stories engaging and immersive, with Brandon Sanderson being one of my favorite authors for his intricate world-building and compelling narratives. In addition to audiobooks, I enjoy listening to music throughout the day.
