~~I aspire to get a consulting role in a esteemed organization where I can drive impactful solutions and contribute to organizational success.

**Describe your strengths and weakness as identified by you.**

One of my key strengths is my ability to work effectively in team settings, fostering collaboration and ensuring that all perspectives are valued. I also possess strong communication skills, enabling me to articulate ideas clearly and build meaningful professional relationships. Additionally, I excel under pressure, maintaining focus and delivering high-quality results even in demanding situations.

A key area for improvement is time management. I sometimes find it challenging to prioritize effectively, especially when managing multiple responsibilities. To address this, I have adopted tools such as planners and digital calendars to organize my tasks better. By consistently applying these methods, I am steadily improving my ability to manage time more efficiently and balance competing priorities effectively.

**What is your most significant accomplishment so far ?**

During my pre final year of college, I discovered an opportunity to work as a social media manager for a fashion event. Despite my initial hesitation and fear of reaching out to unfamiliar people, I decided to step out of my comfort zone, made the call, and successfully secured the role. This experience was pivotal in building my confidence and strengthening my professional communication skills.

**What are your present hobbies ?**

I have a strong interest in audiobooks, particularly those in the fantasy and science fiction genres. My favorite book of all time has been a sci-fi book, Ready Player One. I also like listening to a lot of Podcasts, especially in consumer technology and technology news. Additionally, I occasionally also enjoy playing and organizing Table Top Role-Playing Games with friends.

**Any other information you would like to share ?**

During my engineering studies, I explored affiliate marketing as a side hustle by managing an Instagram page. Within six months, the page gained over 6,000 followers, demonstrating my ability to grow an audience and create engaging content. However, despite the page's success in building a following, I was unable to monetize it effectively. This experience taught me valuable lessons about digital marketing strategies and the challenges of converting engagement into revenue.

Additionally, I had the opportunity to lead a team in my college’s design department. We were responsible for creating digital assets and videos for the college cultural festival. Managing a team of multiple members under tight deadlines and adapting to frequent changes in requirements was challenging but rewarding. Through effective coordination and a shared commitment to quality, we successfully delivered all the necessary digital materials for the event. This experience honed my leadership, teamwork, and project management skills, all of which I continue to leverage in my professional endeavors.
