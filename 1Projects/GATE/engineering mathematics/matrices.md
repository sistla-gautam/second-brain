## calculating eigenvalues
- if given a matrix, subtract $\lambda$ from the diagonal elements
- after this, find the determinant of the resultant matrix
- the determinant will contain an equation of $\lambda$. equate that to 0
- find the different values of $\lambda$, those are the eigenvalues

#### shortcut method to caluclate
- the equation can be derived by a simple set of steps
