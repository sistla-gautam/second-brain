As an assignment for this weekend. I want us to look up and read resources regarding ai agents. 
**As to what they are**.  
**What do they mean?**  
**Where do they fit?**  
**What is required in terms of resources to build them?**
Put up your understandings with the resources from which you based them like YouTube videos or articles in the channel. At the end of the weekend preferably, I want answers to these 3 questions above.
