# so that I can spend it (wisely)

**simple breakdown of your income (simple budgeting)**
- 50% for basic needs
	- essential expenses that you cannot live without
	- rent, EMI, food, transport, internet bills
- 30% for wants, desires
	- things that you dont need, but desire
	- things that make you happy, things you love
	- weekend getaways, fancy phone, party, eat out
- 20% for savings
	- to invest
	- to build for a future you

**breakdown for the increments**
- 50% for savings
- 30% for wants
- 20% for needs

**reasoning**
- your needs to do not grow with your income
- you keep building the ratio towards your investments
- you still keep 30% for your wants

**discipline about spending**
- if your wants budget is 10k per month
	- but you want to buy a 25k phone
- get a no cost EMI option
	- or wait 3 months till it fits in your budget
- forces you to cut your spending on things that you DONT love
	- so you can spend on things you DO want

> If you buy things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need - *Warren Buffett*


**before you spend, ask a WHY**
- Take a pause
	- reflect on the WHY before you take the BUY
- check - is this something that I really want, or is this something I want because everyone else wants it?
	- if yes, make the budget and go ahead
	- saying no is hard when FOMO and peer pressure are in play



**hidden costs**
Also called as *Phantom Costs*
- check for hidden costs when buying new things
- house - brokerage, registration, property tax
- car - registration, insurance, taxes, fuel
- weekend trip - transport, 1 beer that becomes 10

**Making money from credit cards**
- credit cards are like mini loans
- if you are making a big purchase at the start of a month
	- invest this amount into a short term debt fund
- this will return us interest on money which we have "spent"
==TIP== - Get your first credit card with zero fees. If not possible, get a credit card that is backed by a fixed deposit

# but people tell me I should save

### how do I start saving
- saving only makes sense when you have a goal to achieve
- without the "how much", it is just a random number

- there will not be anything that will stop you from spending

- but saving "for a vacation" or "saving for a house" gives the saving a purpose

### goal setting
set 3 different goal time line
- long term goals - >10yrs
	- kids education, retirement, house down payment
- medium term goals - 10 - 3yrs
	- international vacation, further education
- short term goals - <3yrs
	- phone, car, vacation

### saving first mindset
- savings = needs - ego
- your actual needs are rent, food, transport: essential bills
- ego - the fancy drink from Starbucks, the newest phone, coolest sneakers
- when you take the ego expenses out of the needs, thats what are the savings

### tips to make saving easier
- automate
	- monthly transfer the required amount into the necessary places
