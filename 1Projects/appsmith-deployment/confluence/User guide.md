#### Accessing the application from other applications
- Once deployed, the application will be deployed on a particular URL.
- This URL will be used to navigate to the application.
- The URL can be pasted into other internal tools, and can hence be accessed.
- The URL will only point to the deployed version of the application and not the editor of the application.
