- the highly analytical person
- has multiple spreadsheets just to make a decision
- logic takes over the precedence over anything else

###### main moto
- the person who is basically the know it all
- the work they do is much more important than they themselves
	- awarding them for their work is almost pointless. most often, they do not even celebrate their wins
- despite such knowledge, they have no intention to boast about them
	- if they know something, they almost never reveal about it unless someone asks them
