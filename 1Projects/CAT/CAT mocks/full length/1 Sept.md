- due to a glitch, only submitted the DILR and quant section
- so did not get any score for VARC section despite attempting it

# VARC
#### problems
- was not able to solve para jumbles properly
- most of the questions in parajumbles were mistakes
	- dont remember the exact number of questions

# DILR
#### problems
- only solved one set with some struggle
- realized I made a mistake during the solving of the questions and lost motivation to continue
	- a silly mistake caused the problem
- came back to it after 2 mins and was able to completely solve it
#### takeaways
- should try for another set despite loosing another set
- would have been able to attempt some questions at least from the next set 
	- after attempting that set, we can then try the previous set

# Quant
### problems
- attempted only 6 questions
- out of these 6, only 3 were correct
- most of the other questions were questions that were fairly simple and could be solved
	- the guilt of only 1 set in DILR was carried over to the next section

#### takeaways
- treat each section as a separate sectional mock
- do  not carry over the emotions of 1 section to the other
