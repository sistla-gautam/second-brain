## 15 Sep
- VARC got clapped
- QA and DILR - gave a sense of - I know what I need to do in this. VARC did not give this at all

###### VARC
- felt very much tired when I tried to solve this section
- taking too much time when I am trying to solve each RC
- reading comprehension needs to improve speed

###### DILR
- Question selection needs to be a little more specific. Most likely got lucky here when trying to solve this section
