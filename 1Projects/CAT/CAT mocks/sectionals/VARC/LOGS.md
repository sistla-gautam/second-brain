### 9 sept
- did not read the paragraph properly. was in a rush to get it done which was caused by the new technique
- also read some questions wrong

### 29 sept
- lost a lot of marks in VA
- solved 3 RCs. not sure if I should aim for higher number of passages
- lot of improvement in RC. very less number of mistakes. can be better
