| 9 Sept | 22    | focus on P&C. learn common tables, squares, cubes. |

### 9 sept (LR for OMETs)
- permutation and combination needs practice. lost easy marks due to lack of practice
- failed to recognize a common fraction. small mistake that could have been covered by revising the quants once before giving the test
