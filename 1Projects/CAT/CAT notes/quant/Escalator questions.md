- distance is taken in number of steps
- speed is taken in steps per second
---
- number of steps of escalator is always constant
- number of steps of the escalator is the sum of
  (when both are moving in same direction)
	- number of steps taken by the person
		- steps per sec * time taken
	- number of steps taken by the escalator
		- steps per sec * time taken

###### relation between the different speeds and time
the relative speed of a person on an escalator in the following conditions
- same direction as escalator (person + escalator)
- when turned off (person)
- opposite direction (person - escalator)
are all in AP

similarly, the time taken by then is in HP (the distance is constant. hence, the speed is inversely proportional to time)
