- identify the main idea of the sentences
- find the opening and closing sentences
	- most common arrangement is triangle or inverted triangle model

	- usually the author will explain something and then give more explanation of the same
	- the author might also give some sort of example
	- the flow might be
		- idea 1 -> example 1 -> idea 2 -> example 2
###### finding the opening and closing sentences
- pronouns
- this/ that/ these/ those
- transition words
	- transition words will tell which way the conversation will flow towards
	- transition words will also give rise to change in direction
		- segregating the sentences into +ive and -ive will be much easier with transition words

###### find the transition words
- these transition words will tell how the idea will follow
- usually, they will continue right after a much broader idea and will narrow down to a much more specific idea

###### pronouns 
- the author will showcase an subject
- pronouns will only come once the subject has already been introduced
