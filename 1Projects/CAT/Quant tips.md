- for a given value x, we have
	- $(1 + \frac{1}{x})^x$ will increase as x will increase
- ![[Pasted image 20240721163629.png]]
	- in this case, we have 4 numbers in a GP. if we are to just find the numbers, we can use $\frac{a}{r}$, $a$, $ar$
	- since we have summation here, we can use $a$, $ar$, $ar^2...$
- for questions pertaining the domain 
	- always find the constraints
	- if it is log
		- the base should always be greater than 0, and not equal to 1
		- the value should be greater than base
	- if it is root
		- the value under root should be positived
