# detect incoming headers
- this is not possible
- only query parameters are possible

# open android applications
- this is possible
- this is achieved with an intent
	- need to be configured in the application
	- need to be configured on how to accept this intent
- a fallback url also needs to be configured if the application is not present

# meeting notes

### SVG 
- run the script once a month
	- find the intersection between the file in the editor and the files in the file storage
	- figure out what are not being used
	- remove them from the storage

### interactive forms
- the application should ideally be able to support the web view of the interactive forms
- all are from same domain, so should be able to get the required webpage to render
- clicking back, it should be able to come back to the same dashboard
