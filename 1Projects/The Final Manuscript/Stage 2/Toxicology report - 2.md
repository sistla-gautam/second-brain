**CONFIDENTIAL TOXICOLOGY ANALYSIS**

Case #: 2458-B

Subject: Eleanor Blackwood

Date of Analysis: November 13, 2024

**FINDINGS:**

Analysis of blood and tissue samples reveals presence of three distinct compounds:

1. Diazepam (5-10mg estimated dose)
    - Consistent with prescription medication
    - Concentration suggests ingestion 2-3 hours before death
2. Amobarbital (15-20mg estimated dose)
    - No prescription on record
    - Concentration suggests ingestion 1-2 hours before death
3. Compound XR-27 (experimental pharmaceutical)
    - Not approved for medical use
    - Associated with clinical trials conducted by Meridian Pharmaceuticals
    - Known to enhance effects of sedatives when combined
    - Not detectable by standard toxicology screening

**CONCLUSION:**

The combination of these three substances created a synergistic effect resulting in respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. This specific combination would require sophisticated pharmaceutical knowledge. The staggered introduction of compounds suggests intentional, planned poisoning.

NOTE: Compound XR-27 is currently in Phase II clinical trials. Records indicate Dr. Lillian Carter consulted on these trials between 2022-2023.
