- Timeline Discrepancies document (full version)
- Complete Manuscript Excerpt with margin notes
- Toxicology Report (basic findings only)
- Two New Suspect Profiles (James Morrison, Katherine Blackwood)

**Stage 2 Objectives:**

1. Recognize that multiple people had opportunity despite their alibis
2. Identify the significance of the deleted voicemail
3. Determine that the poison was a multi-compound mixture requiring specialized knowledge
4. Evaluate the new suspects and their potential connections
5. Begin to notice connections between certain suspects (especially Daniel and Lillian)

**Completion Requirement:** Players must correctly deduce that at least two people were involved in the murder and identify the significance of the manuscript as more than just a blueprint (hint that it contains real information, not just fiction).
