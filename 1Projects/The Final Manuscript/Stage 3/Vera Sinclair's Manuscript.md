**THREE DAYS TO NOWHERE**

### **Chapter 18**

...Margaret tasted the bitterness the moment the wine touched her tongue. A barely perceptible sharpness beneath the usual dry warmth. By the time she recognized it, the damage had already been done. The mixture was precise—an anti-anxiety drug laced with a secondary agent that would quicken absorption. Harmless on its own. Deadly when paired with alcohol.

She had been waiting for something like this. That was why she had started keeping records months ago. The inconsistencies in the financial audits. The private shipments listed under vague medical research grants. The quiet transfers to accounts in jurisdictions known for secrecy. She had written everything down, stored copies in places no one would think to check.

The room wavered slightly as Margaret set down her glass. Her study door was bolted, as always—a habit she never broke when working late. The key lay in the dish beside her, exactly where it always was. Whoever had planned this had been counting on her routine.

She reached for her notebook, but her vision swam. The pen slipped through her fingers. She needed to reach Samuel. He had suspected something was off, but he hadn’t yet seen the full picture. The connection between the publishing firm and the offshore clinical trials was too dangerous to expose carelessly. Others had already paid the price for getting too close. The "heart failure" that had taken her editor last month hadn’t been natural.

She struggled to lift her arm, but her body was already failing her. From outside, a faint creak on the balcony. They would wait until the drug left her too weak to fight back. Then they’d manipulate the scene—a window left ajar, an unfinished letter by her side. By morning, the cause of death would seem like an accident. A tragic miscalculation.

A perfect crime. Just like the last one...

### **Chapter 27**

Dr. Samuel Whitaker had known fear before. The kind that came in whispers behind closed doors, in late-night phone calls that cut off too suddenly. But this—this was different. This was the slow, creeping dread of inevitability.

The walls of the facility were pristine, sterile. Too clean. Too silent. A controlled environment where nothing happened by accident. The IV line in his arm dripped steadily, the fluid clear, unassuming. Just another “routine test” for a drug he had once helped develop.

Except he wasn’t here by choice.

He had tried to warn them. The trial results were doctored, the side effects buried under layers of corporate deception. The drug—MX-12—was lethal in high doses, and even at controlled levels, it was unpredictable. Patients in the offshore trials had convulsed, their organs shutting down within days. He had seen it himself. He had written it down.

And someone had read what he wrote.

The last thing he remembered before waking up in this room was the sharp sting of a needle in his neck, the muffled voices as he was dragged from his apartment. Now, strapped to a hospital bed, he felt the first symptoms creeping in—muscle spasms, pressure behind his eyes, a strange detachment from his own body.

He tried to sit up, but his limbs wouldn’t respond.

Outside the observation window, figures in white coats watched in silence. No one rushed to help. No one reached for the emergency button. They were waiting. Studying.

He had become their final subject.

His breath hitched, a sudden tightness in his chest. The irregular heartbeat, the first warning sign. The same reaction as the others. He forced his fingers to move, reaching for the pulse oximeter clipped to his fingertip. His heart rate was spiking.

Too fast. Too soon.

Through the haze, he saw one of the figures outside turn away, speaking into a recorder. **“Subject 47 displaying accelerated response. Fatal progression likely within three hours.”**

Not **Dr. Whitaker.** Not **whistleblower.** Just **Subject 47.**

The realization settled over him like a weight. They had erased him before he was even gone. His files, his notes—would they ever be found? Or had they already been destroyed?

He clenched his teeth, forcing his fading strength into one last movement. His fingers curled into a fist, then scratched at the bedside table, his nails dragging against the plastic surface. If anyone found him, if anyone cared to look, they would see the message etched in shallow, desperate lines:

**“MX-12 KILLS.”**

But even as his vision darkened, he knew the truth.

By morning, his body would be another statistic.

Another “unforeseen complication.”

Another loose end, tied up.
