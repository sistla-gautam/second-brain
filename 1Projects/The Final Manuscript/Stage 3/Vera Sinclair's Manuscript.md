**THREE DAYS TO NOWHERE**

_by Vera Sinclair_

Chapter 18

...Margaret tasted the bitterness the moment the wine touched her tongue. A barely perceptible sharpness beneath the usual dry warmth. By the time she recognized it, the damage had already been done. The mixture was precise—an anti-anxiety drug laced with a secondary agent that would quicken absorption. Harmless on its own. Deadly when paired with alcohol.

She had been waiting for something like this. That was why she had started keeping records months ago. The inconsistencies in the financial audits. The private shipments listed under vague medical research grants. The quiet transfers to accounts in jurisdictions known for secrecy. She had written everything down, stored copies in places no one would think to check.

The room wavered slightly as Margaret set down her glass. Her study door was bolted, as always—a habit she never broke when working late. The key lay in the dish beside her, exactly where it always was. Whoever had planned this had been counting on her routine.

She reached for her notebook, but her vision swam. The pen slipped through her fingers. She needed to reach Samuel. He had suspected something was off, but he hadn’t yet seen the full picture. The connection between the publishing firm and the offshore clinical trials was too dangerous to expose carelessly. Others had already paid the price for getting too close. The "heart failure" that had taken her editor last month hadn’t been natural.

She struggled to lift her arm, but her body was already failing her. From outside, a faint creak on the balcony. They would wait until the drug left her too weak to fight back. Then they’d manipulate the scene—a window left ajar, an unfinished letter by her side. By morning, the cause of death would seem like an accident. A tragic miscalculation.

A perfect crime. Just like the last one...
