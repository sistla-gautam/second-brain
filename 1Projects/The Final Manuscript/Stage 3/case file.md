### **INITIAL ASSESSMENT**

Dr. Edward Langston was last seen by his neighbor, Martha Ellis, at approximately 9:15 PM on July 1, 1994. According to her statement, she heard a brief struggle from inside Langston’s apartment, followed by a loud thud. When she knocked on his door moments later, there was no response.

Dr. Langston’s personal journal was discovered on his desk, with a partially written entry:

_"If anything happens to me, the trials were never meant to be safe. They knew. They all knew. I have proof—bank transfers, shipment logs. I need to move fast. They’re watching me."_

Additionally, there were burnt papers found in the fireplace, but they could not be retrieved.
