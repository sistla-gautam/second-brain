### CASE FILE: INTRODUCTION

**POLICE REPORT** Case #: 2458-B Date: November 12, 2024 Reporting Officer: Detective Michael Hayes Victim: Eleanor Blackwood, 58 Location: Blackwood Manor, 1427 Raven Hill Road Time of Death: Between 8:00 PM - 10:00 PM on November 11, 2024 Cause of Death: Poisoning (toxicology details pending)

**INITIAL ASSESSMENT**

Eleanor Blackwood was found deceased in her private study at 10:48 PM by her husband, Robert Blackwood. The door to the study was locked from the inside, with the key in the victim's pocket. The window was closed but unlocked. A glass of whiskey on the desk contained traces of diazepam and an unidentified compound. The victim's personal physician, Dr. Lillian Carter, initially suggested the death may have been suicide, given the locked room and the victim's recent bouts of insomnia.

**CASE STATUS UPDATE**

Investigation reclassified as HOMICIDE following the discovery of the victim's unfinished manuscript, which describes in detail a fictional murder with striking similarities to the actual crime scene. Evidence suggests the killer may have used the manuscript as a blueprint.

### MANUSCRIPT EXCERPT

**THE PERFECT MURDER**

_by Eleanor Blackwood_

_(Unfinished manuscript - CONFIDENTIAL)_

Chapter 3

...Victoria knew her drink had been tampered with the moment she tasted the subtle bitterness beneath the smoky flavor of the whiskey. But by then, it was already too late. The combination was clever—a prescription sedative mixed with another compound that would accelerate and amplify its effects. Tasteless when combined with alcohol. Untraceable to all but the most thorough toxicology screenings.

She had expected this, of course. That's why she'd begun documenting everything two months ago. The financial records. The medical shipments. The offshore accounts. All of it meticulously recorded and hidden where only someone who knew to look would find it.

The room began to blur at the edges as Victoria set down her glass. The study door was locked—she always locked it when working on sensitive material. The key rested in her pocket, as always. Her killer had counted on these habits.

Victoria reached for her phone, fingers growing numb. She needed to warn Andrew about what she'd discovered. The connection between the publishing house and the pharmaceutical trials was too dangerous to ignore. People had already died to keep this secret. Her research assistant's "accident" had been just the beginning.

The phone slipped from her grasp as the paralysis began to take hold. She could hear movement outside the window now. They would wait until she was unconscious, then use a thin wire through the keyhole to create the perfect locked-room mystery. By morning, the poison would be nearly undetectable in her system.

The perfect murder, designed to look like suicide. Just as they had done to...

### TOXICOLOGY REPORT

**CONFIDENTIAL TOXICOLOGY ANALYSIS**

Case #: 2458-B

Subject: Eleanor Blackwood

Date of Analysis: November 13, 2024

**FINDINGS:**

Analysis of blood and tissue samples reveals presence of three distinct compounds:

1. Diazepam (5-10mg estimated dose)
    - Consistent with prescription medication
    - Concentration suggests ingestion 2-3 hours before death
2. Amobarbital (15-20mg estimated dose)
    - No prescription on record
    - Concentration suggests ingestion 1-2 hours before death
3. Compound XR-27 (experimental pharmaceutical)
    - Not approved for medical use
    - Associated with clinical trials conducted by Meridian Pharmaceuticals
    - Known to enhance effects of sedatives when combined
    - Not detectable by standard toxicology screening

**CONCLUSION:**

The combination of these three substances created a synergistic effect resulting in respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. This specific combination would require sophisticated pharmaceutical knowledge. The staggered introduction of compounds suggests intentional, planned poisoning.

NOTE: Compound XR-27 is currently in Phase II clinical trials. Records indicate Dr. Lillian Carter consulted on these trials between 2022-2023.

### GAME MASTER'S SOLUTION KEY

**THE CULPRITS:** Daniel Brooks and Dr. Lillian Carter

**THE TRUE MOTIVE:** Eleanor discovered that Daniel's publishing company was laundering money for illegal pharmaceutical trials conducted by Dr. Carter. Her manuscript wasn't fiction—it was a documented exposé of their crimes, including evidence connecting them to the death of her research assistant who had initially discovered the connection.

**THE MURDER METHOD:**

1. Dr. Carter prescribed diazepam to Eleanor, knowing she would take it that evening
2. Daniel added amobarbital to Eleanor's whiskey bottle during a meeting earlier that day
3. Dr. Carter provided the experimental compound XR-27 from her clinical trials, which Daniel added to the glass directly
4. The combination created a lethal effect that appeared similar to suicide

**THE LOCKED ROOM TRICK:** Daniel waited outside the study window until Eleanor lost consciousness. He entered through the window, arranged evidence to suggest suicide, then exited the same way, using a thin wire through the keyhole to lock the door from the outside.

**KEY EVIDENCE:**

1. The manuscript contains actual details of their crimes, not just fictional elements
2. The toxicology report shows three substances that could only be combined with both medical knowledge (Dr. Carter) and physical access (Daniel)
3. Timeline discrepancies show both suspects had opportunity during their supposed alibis
4. Daniel's fingerprints on manuscript pages with dates after he claimed to have last seen Eleanor
5. Dr. Carter's connection to the experimental drug trials referenced in Eleanor's notes

**RED HERRINGS EXPLAINED:**

- Robert's fingerprints on the glass were from earlier in the day
- Katherine's secretive behavior related to reconciliation attempts, not murder
- Vera's train journey included a stop that theoretically provided opportunity, but timing makes her involvement impossible
- Henry's dog was near the property because he was actually meeting with Katherine, with whom he had begun a relationship
