### CASE FILE: INTRODUCTION

**POLICE REPORT** Case #: 2458-B Date: November 12, 2024 Reporting Officer: Detective Michael Hayes Victim: Eleanor Blackwood, 58 Location: Blackwood Manor, 1427 Raven Hill Road Time of Death: Between 8:00 PM - 10:00 PM on November 11, 2024 Cause of Death: Poisoning (toxicology details pending)

**INITIAL ASSESSMENT**

Eleanor Blackwood was found deceased in her private study at 10:48 PM by her husband, Robert Blackwood. The door to the study was locked from the inside, with the key in the victim's pocket. The window was closed but unlocked. A glass of whiskey on the desk contained traces of diazepam and an unidentified compound. The victim's personal physician, Dr. Lillian Carter, initially suggested the death may have been suicide, given the locked room and the victim's recent bouts of insomnia.

**CASE STATUS UPDATE**

Investigation reclassified as HOMICIDE following the discovery of the victim's unfinished manuscript, which describes in detail a fictional murder with striking similarities to the actual crime scene. Evidence suggests the killer may have used the manuscript as a blueprint.
