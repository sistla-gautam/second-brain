Subject: Re: Your concerns  

Eleanor,  

Your notes on the financial irregularities and clinical trials are confirmed. Trial #27 deaths align exactly with fund transfers through Nightshade Properties—same account DB used.  

If your latest draft names them outright, you’re in danger. The study wasn’t "flawed," it was intentional. The three-compound mixture ensures delayed symptoms, making it look like natural causes.  

They can’t afford exposure. You need to secure the original manuscript and the safe deposit key. If anything happens, the **floor plan annotations** will prove how they staged it.

P.S. The safe code is unchanged. Trust no one.
