## INITIAL WITNESS STATEMENTS

### Maya Williams (Personal Assistant)

"I came by to drop off some contracts he needed for tomorrow's meeting. I tried calling several times but he didn't answer, which was unusual. I have a key, so I let myself in at about 10:30. I found him... like that. We were supposed to have a video call at 9:00 PM to go over his schedule for the week, but he canceled last minute, said something urgent came up. Mr. Reeves has been acting strange the past few weeks - secretive, stressed. He's been having a lot of closed-door meetings with people I don't recognize."

### Claire Reeves (Ex-Wife)

"Yes, Victor called me earlier. He wanted to discuss changing the terms of our divorce settlement. Something about his company facing financial trouble. We argued, as usual. I was at a charity gala from 8 PM until midnight - hundreds of people saw me there. Victor was paranoid lately, talking about people betraying him. The man made enemies everywhere he went."

### Edward Frost (Head of Security)

"The security system requires a master code to disable. Only four people have it: Mr. Reeves, Ms. Williams, myself, and Ms. Chen, the housekeeper. I was off duty last night, but received an automated notification when the system was disabled. I assumed Mr. Reeves had authorized it since the master code was used. There were no alarms or disturbances reported."

### Thomas Chen (Estate Groundskeeper)

"I left at 6 PM as usual. Mr. Reeves was alive and well, working in his office. He had me deliver a package earlier to Dr. Reynolds at Nexus Labs - said it was confidential research materials. Mr. Reeves seemed tense but wouldn't say why. I noticed an unfamiliar black sedan parked down the street when I left, but didn't think much of it."

## HINTS

<details> <summary>Hint 1</summary> Examine the security log times carefully against the timeline of events. </details> <details> <summary>Hint 2</summary> The notepad indentation "ERTPD - 28551" is a code. What could these letters represent? </details> <details> <summary>Hint 3</summary> Pay close attention to Maya's statement about her arrival time and when the security system was reactivated. </details>

## SOLUTION

<details> <summary>Stage 1 Solution</summary>

**Key Deductions:**

1. The security system was reactivated at 10:30 PM, the same time Maya claimed to arrive.
2. Maya stated she "found him like that" but never mentioned reactivating the security system.
3. The notepad indentation "ERTPD - 28551" is an anagram for "TRAPED" with a reference number.
4. The partial email suggests Victor discovered a security breach related to Project Oracle.
5. The bruising on Victor's wrist indicates a struggle before his death.

**Conclusions:**

- Maya Williams is hiding something about her arrival at the crime scene
- The victim knew something about a security breach and was possibly meeting someone about it
- The time of death coincides with the security system being disabled
- Someone with access to the master security code is likely involved
- Victor Reeves was likely familiar with his killer, given the lack of forced entry

**Next Steps:**

- Investigate Project Oracle and its significance
- Determine what the code "28551" might reference
- Access Reeves' computer for the complete email
- Check security cameras in the neighborhood for the black sedan
- Further question Maya Williams about discrepancies in her story
