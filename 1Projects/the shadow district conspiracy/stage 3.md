# STAGE 3: HIDDEN CONNECTIONS

## CASE UPDATE

As the investigation deepens, hidden connections between the suspects have emerged. The case has also expanded beyond a simple murder to include corporate espionage, blackmail, and the potential theft of groundbreaking technology. A new suspect has entered the picture, and crucial physical evidence has been recovered.

## NEW EVIDENCE

```
BALLISTICS ANALYSIS REPORT #2025-0414-BR

EVIDENCE: 9mm bullet recovered from victim's body
FIREARM TYPE: Match confirmed to Glock 19 handgun

DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Bullet shows unique barrel markings 
matching those from an unsolved armed robbery at GeneTech 
Laboratories (Case #2024-1137) three months ago.

```

### 2. CCTV Footage (Traffic Camera)

### 4. Project Oracle Storage Device (Found in Dr. Reynolds' Safe)

A specialized storage device containing partial Project Oracle code and documentation was recovered from Dr. Reynolds' home safe.

```

### 10. Recovered Travel Documents

Airline ticket and passport in the name of "Mira Winters" with Maya Williams' photo, scheduled for April 14th to Zurich, Switzerland.

## NEW WITNESS STATEMENTS

### Edward Frost (Head of Security)

"I've been reviewing our security protocols and found something disturbing. While the master code was used to deactivate the system, there's a secondary log showing which specific controller was used. The one used that night was assigned to Maya Williams. And there's more - three weeks ago, Maya requested access to our security training modules, specifically the sections on overriding camera systems and creating access blind spots. She claimed it was to help Mr. Reeves with a security audit."

### Dr. Abigail Reynolds (Chief Scientist)

"The storage device Victor sent me contained critical components of Project Oracle, but not the complete system. It's useless without the integration algorithms that were kept in Victor's safe. When I tried accessing the device that evening to verify its contents, I noticed it had already been accessed after delivery. Only someone with advanced encryption knowledge could have done that. I immediately tried contacting Victor but couldn't reach him."

### Restaurant Staff (From Foster's Alibi Location)

"Mr. Foster arrived for his reservation at 8:00 PM with two business associates. He stepped out around 9:15 PM saying he had an urgent call. He didn't return until almost 10:30 PM, apologizing for the extended absence. His guests seemed annoyed by the wait."

### New Witness - Taxi Driver

"I picked up a woman from outside the Reeves Estate around 10:10 PM that night. She seemed in a hurry, nervous. Had a small case with her. Asked to be taken to the Artemis Apartments in Shadow District. Didn't talk much during the ride, but was constantly checking her phone. Left a nice tip though."

### Anonymous Tip (Call to Police Hotline)

"Check Maya Williams' family records. She has a twin sister who was institutionalized years ago. Released recently. That's who you're looking for."

## NEW SUSPECT INFORMATION

### Mira Williams (Maya's Twin Sister)

- Released from psychiatric facility 6 months ago after 5-year commitment
- Expert in computer systems and cryptography
- No official employment record since release
- Physical appearance nearly identical to Maya Williams
- Previous conviction for cybercrimes (identity theft, system infiltration)

## SOLUTION

<details> <summary>Stage 3 Solution</summary>

**Key Deductions:**

1. James Foster organized the theft of Project Oracle to sell to GeneTech
2. Maya Williams and her twin sister Mira Williams were accomplices
3. The murder was carried out by James Foster during his "absence" from the restaurant
4. Maya provided inside access and information while creating alibis
5. Mira (Maya's twin) was the technical expert needed to access Project Oracle data
6. The victim was drugged via the whiskey glass (which has Foster's fingerprints)
7. The gun used was connected to a previous GeneTech robbery, suggesting a deliberate frame attempt
8. The plan included:
    - Maya disabling security and texting confirmation
    - Foster arriving to kill Victor and retrieve blackmail evidence
    - Mira accessing the Oracle device delivered to Dr. Reynolds
    - All parties planning to escape to Switzerland with the technology

**Timeline of Events (continued):**

- 8:45 PM: Maya calls Foster to confirm plan
- 9:10 PM: Maya texts accomplice that "He's alone" and security is disabled
- 9:15 PM: Security system deactivated using Maya's controller
- 9:22-9:25 PM: Foster arrives in black sedan
- 9:28 PM: Foster enters the property
- 9:30-9:45 PM: Foster drugs Victor, retrieves blackmail evidence, kills him
- 9:46 PM: Hidden camera captures Foster at safe (with ruby cufflinks)
- 9:58 PM: Foster exits property with case
- 10:02 PM: Mira Williams approaches property
- 10:10 PM: Mira leaves in taxi to Artemis Apartments
- 10:17 PM: Oracle storage device accessed remotely by Mira
- 10:30 PM: Security system reactivated (by Maya remotely)
- 10:37 PM: Maya "discovers" the body and calls emergency services

**Conclusions:**

- This was a complex conspiracy involving three people: James Foster, Maya Williams, and Mira Williams
- The murder was committed by James Foster
- Project Oracle was the primary target, with the murder necessary to silence Victor Reeves
- The conspirators planned to sell the technology and flee to Switzerland
- Maya used her twin sister to create confusion and establish alibis
- The plan incorporated multiple layers of deception and misdirection

**Next Steps:**

- Secure arrest warrants for James Foster, Maya Williams and Mira Williams
- Locate and secure all components of Project Oracle
- Freeze all Swiss accounts connected to the suspects
- Recover the murder weapon potentially connected to the GeneTech robbery
- Determine the full extent of GeneTech's involvement in the conspiracy
