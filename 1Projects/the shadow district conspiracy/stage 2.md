# STAGE 2: DIGITAL TRAILS

## CASE UPDATE

After initial examination of the crime scene, the investigation has moved to the digital realm. The tech team has managed to access Victor Reeves' laptop and company servers. Several other digital traces have been uncovered that may shed light on the victim's final days and the mysterious "Project Oracle."

## NEW EVIDENCE

### 1. Email Correspondence (Recovered from Server)

**From:** abigail.reynolds@nexusinnovations.com  
**To:** victor.reeves@nexusinnovations.com  
**Date:** April 10, 10:23 AM  
**Subject:** Re: Project Oracle Concerns

Victor,

I've reviewed the diagnostic data and you're right - someone has accessed the test results without authorization. The biometric logs show entry using YOUR credentials at 2:15 AM on Tuesday, but I know you were at the London conference. This is deeply concerning.

The potential applications of Oracle are too dangerous if misused. I've isolated the core algorithm on a separate server as we discussed. The package you requested contains the only physical backup.

We need to identify the breach before moving forward. I recommend suspending all team access until we know who's responsible.

Victor,

The board is breathing down my neck about Oracle. They want a demonstration next week, and I've already promised them results. Your paranoia is getting out of hand - there's no evidence of corporate espionage, just normal development setbacks.

We've invested too much to back out now. If you continue blocking progress, I'll have no choice but to call for a vote of no confidence. Don't forget who helped you build this company from nothing.

This is your final warning as your friend. Don't make me become your enemy.

**Subject:** Re: Your Offer

I can meet tonight at 9:30 to exchange information. Come alone. Bring the evidence you mentioned and the access codes. Once I verify everything, you'll get the proof you need about who's really betraying you.

Don't try anything clever. I know about London.

### 2. Bank Records

Victor Reeves withdrew $250,000 cash from his personal account on April 13th, just hours before his murder. The withdrawal was marked "Personal Investment."

### 3. Phone Location Data

Victor Reeves' phone shows he visited Nexus Innovations headquarters, Oakridge Park, and Dr. Reynolds' home address on April 13th before returning to his estate.

### 4. Security Footage (Nexus Innovations)

Footage shows Victor Reeves entering the secure lab at 7:23 PM on April 13th, leaving with a small case at 7:56 PM. Dr. Reynolds is seen entering the same lab at 8:05 PM, visibly agitated upon exiting at 8:17 PM.

### 5. Decrypted Notes (From Victim's Phone)

```
Project Oracle - Timeline:
- Phase 1: Complete (Neural mapping successful)
- Phase 2: Complete (Predictive algorithm operational)
- Phase 3: 89% (Integration with defense systems)
- Phase 4: Pending board approval

Trust no one. Possible leak sources:
- J.F. (financial pressure)
- A.R. (ethical concerns)
- M.W. (access to all files)
- C.R. (revenge motive?)

Evidence in personal safe - combination changed 4/12
London footage secured - proves everything
```

### 6. Voice Recording (Recovered from Victor's Phone)

<details> <summary>Transcript of Voice Recording</summary>

**Victor:** You need to understand what's at stake here.

**Female Voice (identified as Dr. Reynolds):** I understand perfectly. You're weaponizing a predictive algorithm that was designed to help humanity.

**Victor:** The defense applications were always part of the plan, Abigail. The government grant was explicit.

**Female Voice:** Not like this. Oracle was meant to predict natural disasters, disease outbreaks, climate events - not become a military targeting system!

**Victor:** The core technology is the same. It's just being applied differently.

**Female Voice:** "Differently?" It's being twisted into something dangerous! Do you even realize what would happen if this fell into the wrong hands? It could predict human behavior with 98.7% accuracy!

**Victor:** Which is why security is my top priority now. Someone is already trying to steal it.

**Female Voice:** Then shut it down until we know it's safe.

**Victor:** It's too late for that. Too many people know it works. If we don't control it, someone else will.

**Female Voice:** I want no part of this. I'm taking my name off the project.

**Victor:** That's your choice. But remember your NDA is still binding. Speak to no one about Oracle.

**Female Voice:** Is that a threat?

**Victor:** It's a reminder of your legal obligations. I'll do whatever it takes to protect this company and our work. Whatever it takes.

### 9. Project Oracle Description (Classified File)

<details> <summary>Project Oracle Overview</summary>

PROJECT ORACLE - CLASSIFIED LEVEL 5

Project Oracle represents a breakthrough in predictive algorithms combined with neural mapping technology. At its core, the system can:

1. Analyze massive datasets of human behavior
2. Predict decisions and actions with up to 98.7% accuracy
3. Identify patterns invisible to conventional analysis
4. Operate autonomously once initialized

Initially developed for humanitarian applications (disaster response, pandemic prevention, climate adaptation), recent development has shifted toward defense applications including:

- Threat assessment and prevention
- Strategic response planning
- Identification of hostile actors before they act

Current status: Operational prototype complete, awaiting final integration testing

Security Protocol: Maximum containment

- Biometric access only (Reeves, Reynolds)
- Air-gapped systems
- Physical backup maintained off-site
- No complete documentation exists in any single location

Primary development team:

- Dr. Victor Reeves (Project Lead)
- Dr. Abigail Reynolds (Neural Mapping Specialist)
- Classified Defense Contractor Representatives

WARNING: Full deployment capabilities estimated to provide 4-6 hours advance knowledge of any individual's decisions when provided with sufficient baseline data.

## NEW WITNESS STATEMENTS

### Dr. Abigail Reynolds (Chief Scientist)

"Yes, I argued with Victor on April 13th. Project Oracle was my life's work, but Victor was taking it in a dangerous direction. The government wants to weaponize it - to predict enemy movements, identify 'potential threats.' But the algorithm doesn't distinguish between enemy combatants and ordinary citizens. I threatened to quit, to take my research elsewhere. Victor reminded me of my non-disclosure agreement. I went to his house around 8:30 PM to continue our discussion, but the security gate was locked and he didn't answer my calls. I left after about ten minutes."

### James Foster (Business Partner)

"These accusations are absurd. I was at a business dinner with potential investors until 11 PM on the night of the murder. Yes, Victor and I had disagreements about the company's direction, but that's normal in any partnership. Project Oracle represents billions in potential contracts - of course I wanted to move forward! Victor was becoming increasingly paranoid in recent weeks. As for GeneTech, they approached me about a potential collaboration, nothing more. I would never betray Nexus Innovations."

### Maya Williams (Personal Assistant)

"I didn't mention reactivating the security system because it's automatic - I have a routine. Victor gave me access to almost everything, except his personal safe and certain Project Oracle files. He asked me to clear his schedule for the evening of the 13th but wouldn't say why. The only unusual thing I noticed was that he asked me to book a private jet for the following morning to Switzerland. One-way ticket."

### Claire Reeves (Ex-Wife)

"Victor called me the day before he died, asking if I still had access to my father's place in Zurich. It was strange after months of contentious divorce proceedings. He said he might need to 'disappear for a while' and asked if I would consider coming with him. Said he had made some powerful enemies and discovered something that made him valuable and dangerous. I thought he was being melodramatic as usual."

### Thomas Chen (Estate Groundskeeper)

"The package I delivered to Dr. Reynolds was small, like a hard drive or memory device. When I returned from the delivery, I noticed Dr. Reynolds' car near the estate but didn't think much of it. She visits sometimes for work discussions. Oh, and Mr. Reeves recently had me install a new lock on his private study and add a hidden camera facing his safe. Said he was concerned about unauthorized access to his personal files."

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

### Fingerprint Analysis

The partial fingerprints from the crime scene have been analyzed:

- Whiskey glass: Victor Reeves (dominant) and one unidentified set
- Door handle: Multiple matches including Maya Williams, Edward Frost, Dr. Reynolds, and Victor Reeves
- Window sill: Partial print matches James Foster (from 3 days earlier, confirmed by security logs)
- Safe: Recently wiped clean

### Hidden Camera Footage (Recovered from Victim's Cloud Storage)

A 20-second clip showing someone in a dark jacket attempting to open the safe at 9:46 PM on April 13th. The face is not visible, but the person is wearing distinctive ruby cufflinks.

### Toxicology Report

```
TOXICOLOGY SCREENING - VICTOR REEVES
Sample Type: Blood
Collection Date: April 14, 2025

FINDINGS:
- Ethanol: 0.04% (consistent with moderate alcohol consumption)
- Diazepam: 2.3 mg/L (significantly above therapeutic range)
- No other substances detected

NOTES: Diazepam levels suggest ingestion approximately 1-2 hours before death. 
This concentration would likely cause significant drowsiness and impaired coordination.

## SOLUTION

<details> <summary>Stage 2 Solution</summary>

**Key Deductions:**

1. Victor Reeves discovered James Foster was selling company secrets to GeneTech (rival company)
2. The blackmail evidence against Foster was stored in Victor's safe
3. Victor was planning to flee to Switzerland with evidence of Foster's betrayal
4. The diazepam in Victor's system was likely administered through his whiskey
5. The hidden camera footage shows someone (likely Foster based on the ruby cufflinks) attempting to access the safe after Victor was incapacitated
6. Dr. Reynolds was near the estate but left when she couldn't reach Victor
7. The timeline places James Foster at the estate during the window of the murder despite his alibi claim

**Conclusions:**

- James Foster had strong motive (exposure of his corporate espionage)
- Foster likely drugged Victor's drink, shot him, then searched for the blackmail evidence
- The security system deactivation/reactivation suggests the killer had the master code
- The unidentified fingerprints on the whiskey glass may belong to Foster
- Project Oracle's predictive capabilities made it extremely valuable, worth killing for
- Victor was planning to escape with evidence against Foster

**Next Steps:**

- Verify Foster's dinner alibi
- Check Foster for gunshot residue
- Search for the murder weapon
- Determine if the blackmail evidence was found and removed from the safe
- Locate the Project Oracle backup that was delivered to Dr. Reynolds
