### changes to phone
- turn off all notifications
- centralize the inbox and make it invisible
- purge the phone
	- remove apps that might feel like a distraction
	- if not able to decide the value of an app, remove all of them
		- if required, can be installed back later
- phone off till noon
	- no usage of phone until noon
	- most of the things we actually require can be done on PC
	- schedule the different times when inboxes are cleared and stuff are checked in
		- basically, batch all communications
		- urgent matters can use a separate communication channel
