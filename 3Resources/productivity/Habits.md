[Found on this youtube video by SpoonFedStudy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fesslaSxdqs)

the video talks about 6 things to keep in mind when creating habits

### 1. action oriented, not goal oriented
- keeping goals based on action oriented makes it much more easier to not loose motivation
- instead of keeping a goal of - *I need to loose 5kg*, the goal should be *I need to do 10 pushups everyday*
- loosing weight is not completely under out control, but doing 10 pushups is

### 2. the lego brick
- start from the most bare bone essentials of all
- this can as simple as working for 5 mins, doing 1 pushup, or even learning only 1 new word of a new language
- this key, is to start from a simple lego block

### 3. Anchor
- this is also called as the *trigger*
- this is what will cause the habbit to take place
- like, meditate when having food, listen to audio book when taking a shit and so on
- every time we need to do something fun, it has a certain cost to it

### 4. pavlovs dog
- if we have something that we really want to do, we just need to pair it with the lego bricks
- for instance, if we want to play a game, we can only play that game when we are planking

### 5. the feather
- increase the lego brick with just an extra feather
- whenever we try to pull that lego brick, we try to add an additional feather
- this feather is a very small addition to the lego bricks and will be nothing but some rounding error
- but once we add that, we need to get used to that additional feather until it is part of the lego bricks that we pull

### 6. never stop
- just never stop
