# so that I can spend it (wisely)

**simple breakdown of your income (simple budgeting)**
- 50% for basic needs
	- essential expenses that you cannot live without
	- rent, EMI, food, transport, internet bills
- 30% for wants, desires
	- things that you dont need, but desire
	- things that make you happy, things you love
	- weekend getaways, fancy phone, party, eat out
- 20% for savings
	- to invest
	- to build for a future you

**breakdown for the increments**
- 50% for savings
- 30% for wants
- 20% for needs

**reasoning**
- your needs to do not grow with your income
- you keep building the ratio towards your investments
- you still keep 30% for your wants

**discipline about spending**
- if your wants budget is 10k per month
	- but you want to buy a 25k phone
- get a no cost EMI option
	- or wait 3 months till it fits in your budget
- forces you to cut your spending on things that you DONT love
	- so you can spend on things you DO want

> If you buy things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need - *Warren Buffett*


**before you spend, ask a WHY**
- Take a pause
	- reflect on the WHY before you take the BUY
- check - is this something that I really want, or is this something I want because everyone else wants it?
	- if yes, make the budget and go ahead
	- saying no is hard when FOMO and peer pressure are in play



**hidden costs**
Also called as *Phantom Costs*
- check for hidden costs when buying new things
- house - brokerage, registration, property tax
- car - registration, insurance, taxes, fuel
- weekend trip - transport, 1 beer that becomes 10

**Making money from credit cards**
- credit cards are like mini loans
- if you are making a big purchase at the start of a month
	- invest this amount into a short term debt fund
- this will return us interest on money which we have "spent"
==TIP== - Get your first credit card with zero fees. If not possible, get a credit card that is backed by a fixed deposit

# but people tell me I should save

### how do I start saving
- saving only makes sense when you have a goal to achieve
- without the "how much", it is just a random number

- there will not be anything that will stop you from spending

- but saving "for a vacation" or "saving for a house" gives the saving a purpose

### goal setting
set 3 different goal time line
- long term goals - >10yrs
	- kids education, retirement, house down payment
- medium term goals - 10 - 3yrs
	- international vacation, further education
- short term goals - <3yrs
	- phone, car, vacation

### saving first mindset
- savings = needs - ego
- your actual needs are rent, food, transport: essential bills
- ego - the fancy drink from Starbucks, the newest phone, coolest sneakers
- when you take the ego expenses out of the needs, thats what are the savings

### tips to make saving easier
- automate
	- monthly transfer the required amount into the necessary places
- 30 day rule
	- if you really want something, hold for 30 days before deciding
- try a fortnightly money
	- once a week, stop spending on EVERYTHING
- choose UPI/debit over credit
	- spending on money that you have than on money you dont have
- credit cards only if you have the entire money
	- ONLY if you have the full amount
- make shopping lists
	- stick to them
- rent if its a infrequent user
	- dont buy if it is not being used a lot
- bigger sizes
	- bigger sizes cost less
- deals and discounts
- pay off loans faster
- buy life insurance when you're young
	- much cheaper when younger

# And use the money to protect me

### health insurance
best time to get them is in the 20s
- low premiums, high cover
- can avail no claim bonus
- lower rejection rates

### deciding the coverage required
- hospital days per year x hospital room rate
- 10-15 days for you
- 25-30 days for parents

### best approach for insurance plans
- get both corporate health insurance and personal
- when you switch jobs, corporate cover ends

- you can have 2 plans at the same time
- for cashless payments, only one can be used at one time
- example
	- bill - 4L
	- corporate - 2L
	- peronal - 3L
	- use 3L from your personal plan
	- pay 1L and claim reimbursement from your corporate plan
- most corporate have co-pay
	- you pay 10-20%, the company pays the rest

### things to look out for in insurance 
- pre existing disease coverage
	- check the wait time
	- a year is okay, anything linger is not
- no room rent limit
- cashless hospital network
	- good network of hospitals that support it


### life insurance
- how much coverage
	- 10 times the annual salary - ideally 25 times

### add ons to consider
- critical illness add on
	- gives you payout if you have a critical illness and cannot work
- disability add on
	- gives you payout if you have a disability
- premium waiver for critical illness
- premium waiver for disability

### emergency funds
- ideal to keep for 6 months
- if possible, keep for 12 months
- where?
	- 10% in cash
	- 20% in bank account
	- rest in FDs

# what I really want is to grow my money

### asset allocation
- shield against unexpected losses
- tap into higher gains

### different risks
- talks about different risk and different tools to be used for different risks
- low
	- FD
- medium
	- corporate bonds
- high
	- crypto, stock market

### asset allocation
- simple formula
	- 100 -age percentage should be in high risk allocation
	- rest can be in low risk allocation
- as you get older, it is more safer to keep it in low risk assets than high risk

### rule of 72
- estimates how long does it take to double your money
- if the rate is 12%, then it will take 72/12 = 6 years to double

### how to begin investing
- save. invest. repeat
	- use the 50:20:30 rule
- build a safety net
- save all possible taxes

# And manage my money very well

> Most people overestimate what they can do in a year, and underestimate what they can do in a decade or two; the fact is: you are not a manager of circumstance, youre the architect of your lifes experience - Tony Robbins

# I know I will make mistakes

### low risk vs high risk
- low risk will always mean low returns. your money will not grow with low returns
- high risk does not always mean high returns. you wont get rich overnight just because you took a massive risk

### common mistakes in investing
- playing the "zero risk" gamne
	- this is not feasible. your money will not grow
- short term thinking
	- YOLO is a dangerous drug.
	- the need for instant gratification is much costlier than you think
	- spend, but also budget this spending
- ignoring inflation
	- inflation is slow, but it is certain
- ignoring taxes
	- learn about short term capital gains taxes
	- and try to avoid this if possible
- living beyond your means
	- earn 1rs, spend 2rs
	- spending money you dont have (yet), because EMI, credit cards
- Ego
	- buying for yourself vs buying for "what will people think of me"
- underestimating compounding
	- compounding can be great for investments
	- it can be a real pain for debt
	- close off loans (and credits) as soon as possible
- not accounting the hidden costs
	- refer back to phantom costs for this mistake
- relying on one income stream to build wealth
	- invest, consult, freelance - possible side wealth streams
- zero safety net or margin or error
	- always have a buffer
	- emergency fund, insurance
