# approach 1
#### comprehension 
- get the main idea and get out
	- read the entire passage
		- do not skim the passage, read the passage
	- every time we read the passage, understand the main idea of the passage
	- do not fixate on the small details
	- it is okay if we do not understand some sentence
		- in some cases it is also okay if we do not understand a paragraph
		- skip the sentence or paragraph if needed
- read the questions and options very very slowly
	- the paragraph has been taken as an extract
	- but the questions are set by the paper setter
	- the author is not there to trick you, but the paper setter is

### how to make a mind map of the para
- read the first line of the paragraph very carefully
	- will usually hold most of the information of the entire paragraph
- the rest of the paragraph will either build on it, extend it or support it
- pay close attention to transition words
- main nouns need to be noted
	- if any fact based questions come up, we will know where to go back to
###### main reason to mind map
- improve the focus on the paragraph
- easily understand the overall structure or idea of the paragraph and answer corresponding questions
- will come back for technical or specific questions

---
# approach 2 (did not work, do not use)
- skim the passage to get the type of passage
	- high in data, philosophical, fact based
- go to the questions to understand what is being asked from the passage
	- while doing so, remember to understand the key points from the passage to keep note of
	- some questions are specific, so keep track of these and find out where they are in the passage
- go the passage, and find out

---
# final approach (hybrid of 2 of them)
- read the questions first
	- find out what the paragraph will talk about
	- make note of the places of interest in the paragraph - nouns, where to look out for
- read the paragraph, but keep keywords in mind
- while reading, write down 1 liners about the paragraph once done with that paragraph
