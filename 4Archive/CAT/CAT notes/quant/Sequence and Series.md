### finding the nth term of a series
##### Method 1
- find by observation the nth term
- 2,3,4,5 -> nth term will be n + 1
##### Method 2
- in case we cant find the nth term easily, we need to find the nth term properly
- we need to find the order at which the difference will become equal
	- if the order is 1 - linear equation
	- if the order is 2 - quadratic equation

- using the given terms, we need to calculate the coefficients of this equation

### finding the sum of the terms
- once we have the nth term, we can apply summation over these terms for the required n value

### in case if the difference is a GP
- in such a case, we use a slightly different formula to get the nth term
- we get $t_n= ar^{(n-1)}+bn + c$
	- where r is the common ratio between the terms of different order
- now use this to get the three different coefficients of the equations to finally find the $t_n$

#### Jugaad approach
- calculate the value of the first couple of terms
- this will give us the approximate value of how much the final answer will be
- using this, estimate the value of each option and compare with the guesstimated answer
