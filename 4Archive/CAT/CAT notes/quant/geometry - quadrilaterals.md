## parallelogram
###### properties
- opposite sides parallel and equal
- opposite angles are equal
- diagonal bisect parallelogram into 2 equal areas
- diagonals divide parallelogram into 4 equal areas
- diagonals bisect each other
- $A=height\times base$
---
## Rectangle
###### properties
- properties from parallelogram will carry over
- diagonals will be equal
---
## Rhombus
###### properties
- properties of parallelogram will carry over
- all sides are equal
- diagonals will bisect each other at 90
- $A = \frac{1}{2}d_1d_2$
- $d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 4a^2$ 
---
## Square
###### properties
- all properties of parallelogram and rhombus will carry over
---
## Trapezium
###### properties
- $A = \frac{1}{2}(sum\space of\space parallel \space sides)(height)$

#### Isosceles trapezium
###### properties
- non parallel sides are equal
- both angles of the parallel sides are equal
- both diagonals are equal
- $A= (x+y)(h)$
	- where one parallel side is 2x+y and the other parallel side is y
	- x is the corner portion once the height is drawn
