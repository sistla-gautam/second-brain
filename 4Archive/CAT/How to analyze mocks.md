# question selection (question elimination)
- understand which topic will fetch the marks
- question selection is more important than solving
###### most common mistakes
- we miss out on freebies
- ==spend too much time on a question which we should not have spent ==(this is much more dangerous than the other mistake)

###### how to solve this
- if the question has even the slightest hint of uncertainty, then leave the question
	- spending too much time solving question which are not good are much more worse than leaving freebie questions
- most probable reasons to leave a questions
	- not sure of the options
	- word looks very weird
	- not sure if this is the correct answer

###### exercise during mock analysis
- find out if this RC is worth skipping
- find out 3 questions which are worth skipping
- find out which LRDI set to leave
- find out which questions which you have attempted, which you should have left
# Learning
will fall in either 2 things
- don't know this topic at all
- very slow
# Overall planning
- understand where the errors are occurring 
- when am I getting fatigued
- what do I think I'm good at, but the data says otherwise
- dropping other subjects because the previous subjects were bad (QA was bad because LRDI went bad)
	- instead think of taking "revenge" on the next stage rather than feeling bad about it

# Error logs
- keep an excel sheet which will track every question and the type of question
- the sheet should have the following columns

| **question** | **topic**  | **concept** | **application** | **silly mistake** | **out of box** |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| find the.... | algebra    | Yes         |                 |                   |                |
| when the.... | arithmetic |             |                 | Yes               |                |
- this way, mark every question as either concept problem, application problem, silly mistake or out of the box
- do this for all the questions that you have skipped and all the questions that we got the wrong answers for
