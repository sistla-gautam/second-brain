| 11 Sept | 1     | did not revise for the test, and gave it at a time which was not ideal |

### 11 sept (Geometry)
- Did not revise anything about quants for 3 days. Yet gave the mock with no amount of revision
- most questions were questions that could have been easily solvable, if revision was done
