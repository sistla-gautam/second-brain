## VARC
- aimed for 2 paragraphs and all the VA questions
	- accuracy in VA is not the highest
- better strategy would be to attempt all the passages and all the VA
	- most VA are TITA, so would not loose lot of marks, but it will increase overall marks

## DILR
- wasnt able to solve 2 questions
- solved one question, but took a lot of time to solve the same
- need to spend time on working on optimization problems
- ==better to set weekly targets of 24 sets a week, than 3.5 sets a day==
	- can be worked on more during the weekends
