## 15 Sep
- VARC got clapped
- QA and DILR - gave a sense of - I know what I need to do in this. VARC did not give this at all
- ==preserve the notes and workings from the exam. helpful for analysis==
###### VARC
- felt very much tired when I tried to solve this section
- taking too much time when I am trying to solve each RC
- reading comprehension needs to improve speed
###### DILR
- Question selection needs to be a little more specific. Most likely got lucky here when trying to solve this section
###### QA
- most questions were very much solvable, probably require more practice to identify the pattern

## 12th Oct

###### VARC
- lot of VA error
- RC errors have reduced quite significantly
- Skipped the passage that I should have taken up, but ended up leaving that passage
- Instead took up a passage that I had very less interest in
	- ==note==: skip passages that are more revolving around biology, history, politics?
	- pick up passages that are about IT, technology, science, psychology, economics
- Have to figure out how many questions and what level should I skip
	- 3 passages, all questions?
	- 4 passages, 3 questions each?
