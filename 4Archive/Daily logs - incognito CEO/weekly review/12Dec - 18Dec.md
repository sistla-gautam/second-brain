## things to focus on
- Read books more consistently. Was able to read only on certain days
- Join the gym as soon as I can. Home workout does not seem to be doing well
- Not having enough fun. Life feels very monotone Should do something very different

## report
- Not too focused on work
- Was not great emotionally. Need to see how to switch away from that
