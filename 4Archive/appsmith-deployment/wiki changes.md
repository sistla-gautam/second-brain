You can use this URL to access the application directly. You can also link internal tools or external apps by using the URL. For example, you can link the application to a widget in theÂ [Visualization Template Editor](https://docs.dev.apps.yokogawa.build/en/3__Reference-Material/34__Dashboard/Dashboard/visualizing-data/visualization-widgets/Dashboard-Editor#linking-dashboards/). This enables you to integrate your dashboard with various form applications, providing seamless interaction with REST APIs in a user-friendly interface.
