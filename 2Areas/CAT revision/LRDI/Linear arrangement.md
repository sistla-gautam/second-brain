- in case of a data dense question, we do the following

##### data dense question
- we only need to read the points once
	- reading more than once will only waste our time
- when we read, we note down the points as and when we come across them
	- we either put them into the table, or we put them below the table in short bullet points, in a symbolic manner
	- use simple signs to show likes, dislikes, possible, not possible. use boxes to show order
- once we finish using a point, we strike it off and do not revisit it once again
