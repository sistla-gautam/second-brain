#### difference
- take the difference between two consecutive terms
- now use this to find the pattern
- identify if a series is a difference series
	- the series will not increase or decrease rapidly

#### multiplication
- the consecutive terms will be increase or decrease by a multiplicative factor
- identify a series is a multiplicative series
	- the series will increase rapidly

#### cubes and squares
- sometimes the difference or the ratio will increase in a manner that will follow one of the following series
	- $n^3+n$
	- $n^3-n$
	- $n^3+n^2$
	- $n^3-n^2$

#### fibonacci series
- add the previous 2 terms to get the next term
- sometimes the difference between the two terms will give you the fibonacci series

#### sum of digits
- sometimes the sum of the digits are added to the number itself to get the next number in the series
- the sum of the digits can also be multiplied to the number to get the next number in the series
