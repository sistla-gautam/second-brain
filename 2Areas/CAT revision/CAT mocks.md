## Mock 1 - 11 Aug 2024
- Did not follow strategy when solving for quants
- Got a slight mix up of sets during LRDI
###### Quants
- Lot of mistakes
- 1 correct question
- 10 wrong answers
- weakest section of all sections
###### VARC
- did not read the question properly
- did not read the options properly
- did guess work on the 3rd paragraph. Tried to go through all the RCs in one shot
- did not follow any strategy where I should alternate between RC and VA
- need to work on PARA jumbles
###### DILR
- guessed some answers for sets that I did not attend. Lost marks there
- some calculation mistakes. Could be avoided
- Was able to solve 2 sets easily, but can be extended to three
