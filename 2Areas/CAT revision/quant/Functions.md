	- we first find the value of g(x) for 1 and2
	- we find that the g(x) is a function that changes based on odd or even values
	- do now, we just replace the values into the final equation

- every input to the function has a unique image in the output
- function terminologies
	- **domain** - set of values that x can take where f(x) is defined
	- **range** - set of values that f(x) can take
	- **codomain** - the other possible values in the output set which also includes values that f(x) might not reach
- onto function (surjective function) - functions where the range and codomain are equal
- one to one functions (injective function) - every element in the codomain is mapped by at most one element in range
- bijective function - function that is both surjective and injective
- into functions - functions that are not onto functions

###### number of functions
- total number of functions is given by
	- $n_b ^ {n_a}$ 
- total number of onto functions
	- we first calculate the total number of functions and then remove the values that are not required
	- if $n_b$ = 3 and $n_a$ = 5, then we calculate the following
		- total number of functions = $3^5$
		- number of functions mapping to only single element = 3
		- number of elements that are mapped to exactly 2 elements = $3(2^5 - 2)$
		- total onto functions = $3^5  -  3  -  3(2^5 - 2)$ 

##### general solutions for functions
- f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) 
	- its a linear equation
	- we can assume f(x) to be equal to kx
- f(x+y) = f(x).f(y)
	- exponential
	- assume f(x)=$a^x$
- f(xy) = f(x) + f(y)
	- log function
	- assume f(x)  = k log x
- f(x).f($\frac{1}{x}$) = f(x) + f($\frac{1}{x}$)
	- polynomial
	- assume f(x) = $x^n + 1$
- f(xy) = f(x).f(y)
	- exponential
	- assume f(x) = $x^n$
