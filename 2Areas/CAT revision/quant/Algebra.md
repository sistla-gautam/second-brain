- transformation of equations
	- assume a equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 having roots p and q
	- we can find out the equation whose roots are p +2 and q + 2 by transformation of equations
	- let the new equation be in the form of y
	- this equation needs to have the roots p+2 and q+2. hence y = p+2, q+2
	- ![[Pasted image 20240810123411.png]]
	- therefore y = x+2 => x=y-2
	- substitute this value in the original equation

- dependency check
	- used when we are given multiple equations with multiple variables and we need to find the values of the variables
	- ![[Pasted image 20240811204720.png]]
	- from these equations, 2a + 3b should become 6p.
	- this is only possible when we have the right value of a and b
	- in this equation, we do not know the value of x. but we know the value of its equivalent from other equations
	- so our job is to find a and b, which will be the values with which the equations will be multiplied by to get the correct value
