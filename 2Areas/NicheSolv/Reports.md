        - no update on assignment2 or assignment1
        - worked on removing any js scripts in svg
            - did this by completely removing the script tag from the svg element when it is first uploaded by the user
            - this might not be required, as the SVGMT library itself does not seem to allow scripts to run
                - no output from the script tag was seen when loading a svg with the SVGMT library
