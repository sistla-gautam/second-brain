### main points
- discussed about what parts of the application will require white labelling
- will only require changing the following places
	- title in the title bar
	- favicon in the title bar
	- login screen title
	- login screen image
- main approach will be to change the contents of the application directly once the war file is placed in the tomcat/webapps folder and is extracted
