### CASE FILE: INTRODUCTION

**POLICE REPORT** Case #: 2458-B Date: November 12, 2024 Reporting Officer: Detective Michael Hayes Victim: Eleanor Blackwood, 58 Location: Blackwood Manor, 1427 Raven Hill Road Time of Death: Between 8:00 PM - 10:00 PM on November 11, 2024 Cause of Death: Poisoning (toxicology details pending)

**INITIAL ASSESSMENT**

Eleanor Blackwood was found deceased in her private study at 10:48 PM by her husband, Robert Blackwood. The door to the study was locked from the inside, with the key in the victim's pocket. The window was closed but unlocked. A glass of whiskey on the desk contained traces of diazepam, amobarbital, and an experimental compound XR-27. The victim's personal physician, Dr. Lillian Carter, initially suggested the death may have been suicide, given the locked room and the victim's recent bouts of insomnia.

**CASE STATUS UPDATE**

Investigation reclassified as HOMICIDE following the discovery of the victim's unfinished manuscript, which describes in detail a fictional murder with striking similarities to the actual crime scene. Evidence suggests the killer may have used the manuscript as a blueprint.

# SUSPECT PROFILES

**PROFILE #1: ROBERT BLACKWOOD**

Age: 62

Relationship to Victim: Husband of 30 years and business manager

Occupation: Investment banker (retired), managed Eleanor's literary estate

Background: Robert and Eleanor's marriage had grown increasingly strained over the past year. Financial records indicate Robert made several questionable investments without Eleanor's knowledge, losing a significant portion of their joint savings.

Statement: "I was in my bedroom from 7:45 PM until I found Eleanor at 10:48 PM. I was watching the football game and dozed off. When I woke up, I went to check on her because she hadn't answered when I called out to her earlier."

Evidence Connection: Robert's fingerprints were found on Eleanor's whiskey glass, despite his claim that he hadn't entered the study that evening. Recently discovered draft of divorce papers in Eleanor's personal safe.

---

**PROFILE #2: DR. LILLIAN CARTER**

Age: 59

Relationship to Victim: Personal physician and friend of 25 years

Occupation: General practitioner with specialty in geriatric medicine

Background: Dr. Carter has been Eleanor's physician since Eleanor's first bestseller. She was named in Eleanor's will as a beneficiary until a recent change removed her. Dr. Carter has consulting ties to Meridian Pharmaceuticals and has participated in several clinical trials over the past three years.

Statement: "I attended the Riverview Hospital charity dinner from 7:00 PM until approximately 9:30 PM. I left early because I received a message about another patient. I did not see or speak to Eleanor that evening."

Evidence Connection: Prescription bottle of diazepam (matching the compound in the whiskey) found in Dr. Carter's car. Her clinic records show she prescribed this medication to Eleanor two weeks prior. A vial of experimental compound XR-27 was found concealed in a hidden compartment of her medical bag during a subsequent search.

---

**PROFILE #3: DANIEL BROOKS**

Age: 45

Relationship to Victim: Editor and publisher for 15 years

Occupation: Senior Editor at Midnight Press

Background: Brooks has edited all of Eleanor's most successful novels. Recent financial troubles at Midnight Press have placed him under significant pressure to deliver another bestseller. Cell phone records show three calls between Brooks and Dr. Carter in the week preceding Eleanor's death.

Statement: "I was at the Harrington Hotel bar from 8:00 PM until around 10:30 PM. I had a meeting with another author earlier in the day but hadn't seen Eleanor since our lunch meeting three days ago."

Evidence Connection: Draft pages of Eleanor's unfinished manuscript found in his briefcase with his fingerprints on pages dated the day of the murder. Brooks claims Eleanor gave him these pages during their lunch meeting, but her personal calendar shows a meeting with him at her home at 2:30 PM on the day of her death, contradicting his statement. A duplicate key to Eleanor's study was found hidden in the lining of his briefcase.

---

Evidence Connection: A handwritten note in Eleanor's study reads: "Vera knows. Too dangerous." Vera's first novel manuscript contains striking similarities to Eleanor's current work.

---

**PROFILE #5: HENRY DAWSON**

Age: 64

Relationship to Victim: Neighbor and rival author

Occupation: Mystery novelist

Background: Once a celebrated author, Dawson's career collapsed after Eleanor publicly accused him of plagiarism seven years ago. He moved to a cottage near Blackwood Manor three years ago, claiming the rural setting helped his creativity.

Statement: "I was walking my dog around the property between 8:45 PM and 9:30 PM. I may have passed near Blackwood Manor but didn't approach the house. I returned home and worked on my manuscript until midnight."

Evidence Connection: A burned matchstick matching Dawson's preferred brand of cigars was found near the study window. His dog's distinctive paw prints were identified in the soft ground below Eleanor's study window.

---

**PROFILE #6: JAMES MORRISON**

Age: 51

Relationship to Victim: Literary agent for 20 years

Occupation: Senior Partner at Morrison Literary Agency

Background: James built his agency's reputation largely on Eleanor's success. Recently, Eleanor had been hinting at moving to a larger agency with her next book series.

Statement: "I was having dinner with clients at Le Blanc restaurant from 7:00 PM until 11:00 PM. The maître d' and several witnesses can confirm this."

Evidence Connection: Email exchange with Eleanor indicating a heated disagreement about her contract terms. Draft contract with competing agency found in Eleanor's desk.

---

**PROFILE #7: KATHERINE BLACKWOOD**

Age: 55

Relationship to Victim: Eleanor's estranged sister

# PHYSICAL EVIDENCE CARDS

**EVIDENCE #1: WHISKEY GLASS AND BOTTLE**

Item: Crystal tumbler with 15ml of whiskey remaining and bottle on desk

Location: Found on Eleanor's desk

Details: Partial fingerprints matching Robert Blackwood and Eleanor Blackwood on the glass. The whiskey bottle showed Eleanor's fingerprints and several smudged areas suggesting it had been wiped. Toxicology detected traces of diazepam, amobarbital, and experimental compound XR-27 in both the glass and remaining bottle contents. Chemical analysis showed the compounds were thoroughly mixed throughout the bottle, not just added to the glass.

Notes: Further examination of the bottle revealed microscopic tool marks on the seal consistent with it being carefully opened and resealed earlier that day.

---

**EVIDENCE #2: LOCKED STUDY DOOR**

Item: Oak door with antique locking mechanism

Location: Main entrance to private study

Details: Door was locked from inside with key found in Eleanor's pocket. No signs of forced entry. Lock examination revealed minute scratches inside the mechanism consistent with a key that doesn't perfectly match the original.

Notes: The study has two potential entry points: the main door and a window overlooking the garden. The key found in Eleanor's pocket showed traces of a polishing compound not found elsewhere in the house, suggesting it had been recently cleaned or polished.

---

Item: 47 pages of typewritten text with handwritten notes

Location: Found on Eleanor's desk and in her personal safe

Details: Unfinished manuscript titled "The Perfect Murder" describes a fictional murder with striking similarities to Eleanor's death, including the locked room, poisoned drink, and method of administering the poison.

Notes: Handwritten annotations in margins included research notes referencing "DB financial records" and "LC medical connection." Detailed notes about "Meridian Pharmaceuticals clinical trials" and "experimental compound XR-27" were found on page 32 with the notation "DANGEROUS - not fiction" underlined twice. Daniel Brooks' fingerprints were found on pages dated the day of the murder.

---

**EVIDENCE #4: PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE AND MEDICAL SAMPLES**

Item: Pharmacy bottle containing diazepam 5mg tablets and research vials

Location: Diazepam found in Dr. Lillian Carter's vehicle; vials of experimental compound XR-27 found in hidden compartment of her medical bag

Details: Prescribed to Eleanor Blackwood two weeks prior to her death. Bottle contains 12 tablets; prescription was for 30 tablets. The research vials were labeled "XR-27" and "For research use only - Meridian Pharmaceuticals."

---

**EVIDENCE #5: BURNED MATCHSTICK**

Item: Partially burned wooden match

Location: Found beneath window of study

Details: Match head shows it was struck and burned briefly. Brand matches distinctive cigars smoked by Henry Dawson.

Notes: Eleanor was known to dislike cigar smoke and did not permit smoking in her home.

---

**EVIDENCE #6: VOICEMAIL RECORDING**

Item: Digital audio file

Location: Retrieved from Eleanor's lawyer's phone system

Details: Message from Eleanor at 7:58 PM: "I've finally figured it out. If something happens to me, check the—" (static, then silence)

Notes: Phone records show the message was remotely accessed and deleted at 9:15 PM. Cellular tower data places Dr. Carter's phone in range of the transmission at this time. A partial fingerprint matching Dr. Carter's was found on Eleanor's landline phone.

---

**EVIDENCE #7: TRAIN TICKET**

Item: One-way ticket to Portland

Location: Found in Vera Sinclair's bag

Details: Departure at 8:30 PM on the night of the murder. Passenger manifest confirms Vera boarded the train.

---

**EVIDENCE #8: FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS**

Item: Bundle of bank statements and financial records

Location: Hidden in false bottom of Eleanor's desk drawer

Details: Records show transfers from Midnight Press to offshore accounts linked to Meridian Pharmaceuticals' unauthorized clinical trials. Annotations in Eleanor's handwriting highlight suspicious transactions between Daniel Brooks and Dr. Carter dating back 18 months.

Notes: Several pages appear to be missing from the sequence, but electronic copies were found on an encrypted USB drive in Eleanor's personal safe.

---

**EVIDENCE #9: SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE**

Item: Digital video file

Location: Retrieved from Harrington Hotel security system

Details: Shows Daniel Brooks in hotel lobby at 8:05 PM, leaving at 8:17 PM, and returning at 10:22 PM. Contradicts his statement about continuous presence at the hotel bar. Additional footage shows Daniel meeting briefly with Dr. Carter in the hotel parking garage at 10:05 PM.

Notes: Hotel bar is not visible in security footage. Bartender has no recollection of serving Daniel that evening. Taxi records show Daniel hired a car at 8:18 PM with a destination near Blackwood Manor.

---

**EVIDENCE #10: DUPLICATE KEY AND WILL MODIFICATION**

Item: Key matching Eleanor's study and legal document with recent amendments

Location: Key found hidden in lining of Daniel Brooks' briefcase; will found in Eleanor's lawyer's office

### MANUSCRIPT EXCERPT

**THE PERFECT MURDER**

_by Eleanor Blackwood_

_(Unfinished manuscript - CONFIDENTIAL)_

Chapter 3

...Victoria knew her drink had been tampered with the moment she tasted the subtle bitterness beneath the smoky flavor of the whiskey. But by then, it was already too late. The combination was clever—a prescription sedative mixed with another compound that would accelerate and amplify its effects. Tasteless when combined with alcohol. Untraceable to all but the most thorough toxicology screenings.

She had expected this, of course. That's why she'd begun documenting everything two months ago. The financial records. The medical shipments. The offshore accounts. All of it meticulously recorded and hidden where only someone who knew to look would find it.

The room began to blur at the edges as Victoria set down her glass. The study door was locked—she always locked it when working on sensitive material. The key rested in her pocket, as always. Her killer had counted on these habits.

Victoria reached for her phone, fingers growing numb. She needed to warn Andrew about what she'd discovered. The connection between the publishing house and the pharmaceutical trials was too dangerous to ignore. People had already died to keep this secret. Her research assistant's "accident" had been just the beginning.

The phone slipped from her grasp as the paralysis began to take hold. She could hear movement outside the window now. They would wait until she was unconscious, then use a duplicate key to enter the room, arrange everything to look like suicide, and leave the original key in her pocket. By morning, the poison would be nearly undetectable in her system.

The perfect murder, designed to look like suicide. Just as they had done to...

### TOXICOLOGY REPORT

**CONFIDENTIAL TOXICOLOGY ANALYSIS**

Case #: 2458-B

Subject: Eleanor Blackwood

Date of Analysis: November 13, 2024

**FINDINGS:**

Analysis of blood and tissue samples reveals presence of three distinct compounds:

1. Diazepam (5-10mg estimated dose)
    - Consistent with prescription medication
    - Concentration suggests ingestion 2-3 hours before death
2. Amobarbital (15-20mg estimated dose)
    - No prescription on record
    - Concentration suggests ingestion 1-2 hours before death
3. Compound XR-27 (experimental pharmaceutical)
    - Not approved for medical use
    - Associated with clinical trials conducted by Meridian Pharmaceuticals
    - Known to enhance effects of sedatives when combined
    - Not detectable by standard toxicology screening

**CONCLUSION:**

The combination of these three substances created a synergistic effect resulting in respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. This specific combination would require sophisticated pharmaceutical knowledge. Chemical analysis of the whiskey bottle indicates all three compounds were present in the bottle, not just added to the glass, suggesting premeditated poisoning.

NOTE: Compound XR-27 is currently in Phase II clinical trials. Records indicate Dr. Lillian Carter consulted on these trials between 2022-2023. Analysis of contents in both the whiskey glass and bottle confirm all three compounds were thoroughly mixed in the whiskey bottle, not added separately to the glass.

### GAME MASTER'S SOLUTION KEY

**THE CULPRITS:** Daniel Brooks and Dr. Lillian Carter

**THE TRUE MOTIVE:** Eleanor discovered that Daniel's publishing company was laundering money for illegal pharmaceutical trials conducted by Dr. Carter. Her manuscript wasn't fiction—it was a documented exposé of their crimes, including evidence connecting them to the death of her research assistant who had initially discovered the connection.

**THE MURDER METHOD:**

1. Dr. Carter supplied all three compounds to Daniel: diazepam (legitimately prescribed to Eleanor two weeks prior), amobarbital, and the experimental compound XR-27
2. Daniel visited Eleanor for a "meeting" at 2:30 PM on the day of the murder and tampered with her whiskey bottle, adding both amobarbital and the experimental compound XR-27
3. When Eleanor took her evening drink with her regular diazepam medication, the combination created a lethal synergistic effect
4. Daniel returned to the manor at approximately 8:25 PM to ensure everything appeared as a suicide
5. Dr. Carter remotely deleted Eleanor's incriminating voicemail at 9:15 PM while leaving the charity event

**THE LOCKED ROOM TRICK:** Daniel entered through the window at approximately 8:25 PM (when the gardener heard the window open and close). After ensuring Eleanor was unconscious/deceased, he:

1. Used a duplicate key (found in his briefcase) to lock the door from the inside
2. Placed the original recently-polished key in Eleanor's pocket
3. Wiped his fingerprints from the whiskey bottle
4. Staged elements of the scene to suggest suicide
5. Exited through the window, carefully closing it behind him

**KEY EVIDENCE:**

1. The manuscript contains actual details of their crimes, not just fictional elements
2. Daniel's duplicate key to Eleanor's study found hidden in his briefcase
3. Toxicology report showing all three substances were mixed in the whiskey bottle, not just the glass
4. Timeline discrepancies show both suspects had opportunity:
    - Daniel left the hotel at 8:17 PM and returned at 10:22 PM, with taxi records placing him near Blackwood Manor
    - Dr. Carter left the charity event at 9:22 PM
    - Security footage shows them meeting at 10:05 PM to coordinate their stories
5. Phone records showing text messages between Daniel and Dr. Carter at key times
6. Experimental compound XR-27 samples found in Dr. Carter's medical bag
7. Eleanor's calendar showing a meeting with Daniel on the day of her death, contradicting his statement

**KEY TIMELINE CLARIFICATIONS:**

- **2:30 PM**: Daniel visits Eleanor, tampers with whiskey bottle during meeting
- **7:58 PM**: Eleanor leaves voicemail for her lawyer, beginning to feel effects
- **8:17-8:25 PM**: Daniel leaves hotel, returns to Blackwood Manor
- **8:25 PM**: Gardener hears study window open/close (Daniel entering)
- **8:25-9:00 PM**: Daniel stages the scene, ensuring the locked room scenario
- **9:15 PM**: Dr. Carter remotely deletes Eleanor's voicemail while leaving charity event
- **10:05 PM**: Daniel and Dr. Carter meet briefly to coordinate their stories
- **10:22 PM**: Daniel returns to hotel after meeting with Dr. Carter

**RED HERRINGS EXPLAINED:**

- Robert's fingerprints on the glass were from earlier in the day
- Katherine's secretive behavior related to reconciliation attempts, not murder
- Vera's train journey included a stop that theoretically provided opportunity, but timing makes her involvement impossible
- Henry's dog was near the property because he was actually meeting with Katherine, with whom he had begun a relationship
